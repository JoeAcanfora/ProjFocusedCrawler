The Charlottesville, Virginia police have officially charged Jesse Matthew, who has a warrant for his arrest, with the abduction of Hannah Graham, the 18-year-old UVA student who went missing on Sept. 13.
During a press conference on Sept. 23, police revealed they are charging Jesse Matthew, 32 — the last person to be seen with Hannah Graham before her disappearance — with abduction with the intent to defile. A warrant was obtained for his arrest on those charges. The 18-year-old University of Virginia student has been missing since Sept. 13, and there’s still no sign of her.

Jesse Matthew Charged With Hannah Graham’s Abduction
Jesse was previously considered a “person of interest” in the case, but was wanted on reckless driving charges for speeding away from the police station on Sept. 20 after a brief interview by investigators.
On Sept. 22, police conducted a second search of Jesse’s apartment and left with several bags of evidence, NBC News reports. What they found must have been enough to charge Jesse with abduction with the intent to defile.

Jesse has not been seen since Saturday; he was not home during the police’s search.
During the press conference on Sept. 23, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said police “absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah even as we speak.”
Hannah Graham: Jesse Matthew Wanted Poster Revealed
HollywoodLife.com spoke to Gary Pleasants, the Support Services Division Commander at the Charlottesville, VA police department, who said: “Jesse Matthew has not turned himself in and we are looking for him.”
The wanted poster states that Jesse is 6’2, 270 pounds, has brown eyes, and brown dreads.
“I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the Earth,” Longo said in a previous press conference on Sept. 19.
Hannah Graham Parents Go Public — Make Emotional TV Plea For Her To Return Home
Jesse, who is a University of Virginia nursing assistant, allegedly told his mom that Hannah did not get in his car after they went to a bar together and they “went their separate ways” after having drinks on Sept. 13.
“I have been talking with his mother,” Jesse’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told Daily Mail. “ He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car. The girl went her way and he went his … I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. They took away his car and three bags out of his apartment.”
But she also added that Jesse, who also goes by the nickname, “LJ,” is a good kid: “LJ would never hurt anybody. I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life. I’m sure he had nothing to do with it.”
HollywoodLifers, we hope Jesse turns himself in voluntarily, but in the meantime take a look at the mugshot in our gallery above and make sure to call 434 – 295 – 3851, with any leads.

Christine Carr- “LJ,” is a good kid: “LJ would never hurt anybody. I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life. I’m sure he had nothing to do with it.”
