CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. –  The University of Virginia family rallied during Saturday’s home football game as the search continued for missing student Hannah Graham. Thousands of University of Virginia students and football fans wore orange “Hope for Hannah” ribbons at Scott Stadium . The color orange represented more than just school pride, it is Hannah’s favorite color.

It has been two weeks since Graham disappeared from the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville. While police continued their search for Graham, abduction suspect Jesse Matthew Jr. awaits an initial court appearance. Matthew arrived in Charlottesville Friday after he was captured in Galveston, Texas, earlier in the week.

The City of Charlottesville, the University of Virginia and the local community have contributed $100,000 to a reward for “information leading to the cause” of Graham’s disappearance. Anyone with information is asked to call the Hannah Graham tip line at 434-295-3851.
