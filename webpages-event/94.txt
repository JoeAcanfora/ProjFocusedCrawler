RICHMOND, Va. — The search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Elizabeth Graham has expanded outside of the Charlottesville area.
Her photo now appears on digital billboards in Virginia, along with a toll-free number for tips from the public.
Once alerted by request from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) activated an endangered missing persons alert on 12 donated full-color digital billboards in Fredericksburg, Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Colonial Heights and Hopewell.
Graham, 18,  was reported missing the afternoon of September 14. She has not been seen or heard from since early Sept. 13.
Anyone with information regarding Graham’s whereabouts should call (434) 295-3851 or 1-800-THE-LOST.
Police have issued a wanted poster and released the photo of Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr.
Matthew, 32, is wanted for misdemeanor reckless driving, however Charlottesville Police have called him a Person of Interest in Graham’s disappearance.
All surveillance videos in this case can be seen here. All reports filed on this case can be found here.
