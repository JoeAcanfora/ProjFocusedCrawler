Man missing for a week found in good health

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Sugar Creek Police Department said Jose Padilla, 41, has been accounted for and is in good health. Padilla had been missing since last Sunday.
According to police, Padilla was checked out by Sugar Creek firefighters and was said to be doing well. He was taken to the University of Kansas Hospital for an evaluation. It’s unclear at this time where Padilla was during the days he was missing.
Friends said in the days preceding his disappearance, they noticed a change in his behavior, including decreased mental capacity.
Police said Padilla did not eat much in the last week and is getting important nutrients at the hospital where he is being looked after by medical staff.
Previous story:
Dozens of volunteers and people searched for Padilla, and with each minute that passed, his friends and family grew more and more worried.
“My main concern is, is he eating, is he drinking, where is he at? Just locating him. He’s never been gone this long,” said Padilla’s cousin, Randy Reyes.
Reyes said Padilla has wandered off in the past.
“He just has his bouts where he disappears,” Reyes said.
Those bouts include depression.
“You can kind of see him being okay sometimes, and not okay other times. He’d been working up until this point at his job here at Jackson County (Detention Center),” said Reyes.
Padilla last showed up for work at the detention center where he is a corrections officer on July 4. He disappeared two days later and his co-workers led the search to find him.
Volunteers split into teams, shared stacks of fliers and bottles of water before they hit the road. Reyes searched some of the industrial areas near where Padilla was last seen. Nilda Serrano says it’s a struggle for everyone at work to stay focused knowing Padilla is missing.
“Jackson County is our family away from home, so he`s one of ours and we want to find him,” she said.
Search crews also made their way to City Market.
“There’s a lot of people who love him and who are concerned for him and want to see him back,” said Reyes.
There is a feeling of desperation while family and friends wait for any word on his whereabouts. In the meantime, Reyes has this message for his cousin:
“Cuz, man, just reach out to somebody. Don’t be afraid to ask for help,” Reyes implored.

I think it might be time to consider the possibility that he killed himself. I would check the river or the wooded regions. I once read that depression is high in that line of work.

Wasting more money on someone that wanders off when he can’t handle stress.

Anon for good reasons

I actually work there, they haven’t fired anyone for doing much worse things, I’m sure he will keep his job. No doubt.
