Col. Steve Sellers addressing the media on the search for Hannah Graham










October 6, 2014
After yet another emotional plea from Sue and John Graham, the search continues as officials desperately look for answers in the case of the missing 18-year-old.
"As you are aware, and individual has been charge with the abduction of our beloved daughter Hannah, however, despite extensive search efforts, no trace of Hannah has been found since she disappeared in the early hours of September 13th, now more than 3 weeks ago," pleaded Sue Graham.
This past weekend a high number of officials were on the ground to look for the missing teen, but still nothing turned up.
"You know, every day there is something that points us in a different direction or some information that comes in that is helpful for this case, even the fact that we're knocking on doors asking to walk through properties," said Albemarle County Police Colonel Steve Sellers.
Heading into this week, officials are waiting to get back high-resolution video from planes that combed the area for the past two days, as there are now 35 searchers still on the ground.
"So we've covered a great deal of that circumference with that 8 mile radius, probably up to about 70 percent, we've got about 30 percent left,” Col. Sellers said.
As the search goes on, Sellers emphasized that many tips still come in and he wants people to come forward if they know Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. in any way shape or form.
"We'd also like people who know him personally, I don't care how long they knew him or how recently, to go ahead and call the tip line and tell us a little bit about what they know about Jesse Matthew," he said.
This past weekend was also the start of hunting season and Col. Sellers said that to his knowledge he did not know of any tips from hunters, but that is something he would follow up on.
