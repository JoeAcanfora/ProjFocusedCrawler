UPDATE: Video of Jesse Matthew bond hearing




Updated at 9:07 p.m.
The Galveston County Sheriff's Office arrested Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr.  Wednesday afternoon on the Bolivar Peninsula, an unincorporated part of the county, a ferry-ride away from the city said TJ Aulds, mainland editor at The (Galveston County) Daily News.
"It ain't too hard to hide down there," Aulds said, referencing its mix of unincorporated communities.
Matthew was arrested on the beach in Gilcrest, on the peninsula, around 3:30 p.m. Central Daylight Time. Aulds said Gilcrest was, "basically wiped off the face of the Earth" by Hurricane Ike in 2008, so there are barely any residences or traffic there. 
Aulds said Sheriff Henry Trochesset told him FBI was on its way down to get Matthew from the Galveston County Jail. Trochesset wouldn't say if Matthew was alone. Investigators from Charlottesville are heading to Texas tomorrow, according to a Galveston press release.
Galveston isn't a stranger to, "having some kind of odd national case end up at our doorstep," Aulds said.  Robert Durst, a millionaire from New York, who was acquitted of murder twice, was arrested in Galveston in 2001, shortly after body parts of his elderly neighbor were found floating in the Galveston Bay.
Bodies of two missing doctors from North Carolina, Leslie and William "Allen" Cargile, were found in a hotel room in Galveston in 2012. 

Updated at 7:35 p.m.
Authorities have arrested Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. in Galveston, Texas, Charlottesville police Chief Timothy J. Longo announced tonight.
Matthew, 32, of Albemarle County, is charged with abduction with intent to defile in the case of Hannah Elizabeth Graham, 18, the second-year University of Virginia student who went missing Sept. 13.
Authorities thanked the Galveston County Sheriff's Department for its help in the case. The process to extradite Matthew from Texas is under way, authorities said.
Police said they believe he was the last person to see Graham on the Downtown Mall before she disappeared.
A reward for information leading to the location of Graham has been increased to $100,000.
Updated at 5:50 p.m.
Charlottesville police have called a 7 p.m. press conference to discuss details of the search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and their efforts to locate a man charged with her abduction.
Police have spent much of the day checking out citizen tips and possible sightings of Jesse Leroy Mathew, Jr who is believed to be the last person to see Graham on the Downtown Mall before she disappeared the morning of Sept. 13.
He was charged Tuesday after forensic results were returned from evidence recovered during searches on his vehicle and residence.

Updated at noon
Nelson County's commonwealth’s attorney says there is no connection between the man convicted in the abduction and death of Alexis Murphy and Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr., the man charged with abducting missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.
Anthony D. Martin, Nelson County's prosecutor, said Dameon Bradley was the person identified by Randy Taylor as being involved with him in Murphy's murder. Taylor was convicted in May of first degree murder of Murphy and Bradley was cleared of any involvement.
"At no time did the name Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr., or a vehicle matching Matthew's, come up in the Randy Taylor, Alexis Murphy case," Martin said in a statement released today. "Dameon Bradley, who testified in Randy Taylor's jury trial, denied Taylor's allegations and had an alibi that was confirmed by law enforcement for the time period that Alexis Murphy went missing."
Martin said frames of a surveillance video shown in Taylor's trial show an orange or red object in the background that some have said could have been Matthew's car but which investigators have determined was a portion of a sign.
"No evidence at this time exists that Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr. had anything to do with the disappearance of Alexis Murphy," Martin said.
Meanwhile, officials from the University of Virginia Medical Center today confirmed that Matthew, who works as a patient technician in the medical center’s operating room, has been suspended without pay.
The suspension is the result of the criminal charge filed against him by the Charlottesville Police Department, a university spokesperson said. Officials declined to comment further on the Matthew’s employment status.
Matthew also served as a volunteer coach with the Covenant School football team  prior to Graham going missing, school officials confirmed. He is no longer serving in that capacity
School officials said Graham's background was checked prior to his serving as a coach and that he passed background checks.
Former Albemarle County and Waynesboro prosecutor Jim Camblos is representing Matthew.

Local, state and federal authorities were searching Tuesday for Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. on charges he abducted University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.
Charlottesville police Chief Timothy J. Longo announced at an evening news conference that investigators had obtained a warrant to arrest Matthew, 32, on a felony charge of abduction with intent to defile. A second-year student, Graham, 18, has been missing since early Sept. 13.
Police have described Matthew, of Albemarle County, as the last person to see her, and they've been seeking him since he sped away from them Saturday shortly after leaving the city police station, where he had gone to ask for the name of a lawyer, police said.
City police Capt. Gary Pleasants said Matthew spoke with a lawyer for roughly an hour, left the station and went to his grandmother’s Albemarle home. A short time later, federal authorities, who had been monitoring Matthew’s movements, saw him drive away in his sister’s car with his mother, traveling at a high rate of speed in a manner so “erratic” and “reckless” that authorities were unable to follow him without endangering themselves and the public, police said.
Authorities subsequently issued an arrest warrant for Matthew on two counts of reckless driving. He hasn’t been seen since.
Longo did not elaborate on what led to the abduction charge, saying only that police had “sufficient probable cause” to obtain a warrant.
Pleasants a day earlier said police expected Tuesday to get state crime lab results from a forensic analysis of items seized in searches of Matthew's car and home. Police took clothes from his Hessian Hills apartment Monday in a second search of the unit. It was unclear late Tuesday whether police had received the forensic results.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the state lab was still analyzing evidence it has received from Charlottesville police, including nearly two dozen items and eight "known samples that we would use for comparison purposes," said Jeffrey Ban, director of the Department of Forensic Science's Central Laboratory in Richmond.
 
Ban said that the department has expedited the case and hoped to provide authorities with results in the "very near future." But he noted the lab could spend hours or even a whole day on a single piece of evidence that may have multiple stains or hairs on it. He also said it is standard procedure to test any samples against those in their database, including those from other missing persons cases in the Central Virginia area.
Matthew was spotted by eyewitnesses walking with Graham out of a bar on the Downtown Mall early Sept. 13, police have said.
Longo last week made impassioned pleas for Matthew to talk to police.
On Tuesday, Longo said he could not provide additional details on the case.
“We need to be very sensitive about the information we share,” Longo said.
As the search for Matthew continued, the chief said, the search for Graham would not stop.
“We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah, even as we speak,” Longo said.
Matthew is employed as a patient technician in the operating room at the University of Virginia Medical Center, where he has worked since August 2012, a spokesman said. He also was a part-time volunteer assistant coach on the Covenant School football team, according to Athletic Director Brooks Berry.
Matthew had a taxi permit from 2007 through 2010, according to Pam Goheen with Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles.
Police describe Matthew as black, 6 feet tall and weighing 270 pounds. They said he last was seen driving his sister’s 1997 light blue Nissan Sentra. Authorities said he has contacts in Virginia, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C.
As the searches continue, digital billboards displaying Graham’s photo and a toll-free tip line will begin appearing in cities throughout Virginia, according to a release from the Outdoor Advertising Association of America.
In the wake of Graham’s disappearance, UVa plans to increase police patrols and the number of safe-ride drivers. University President Teresa A. Sullivan said students should begin using a newly instituted tool for reporting suspicious behavior to university police via their smartphones or the Internet.
An app, dubbed “TipSubmit,” allows students to report to police anything that “doesn’t feel right,” and students also can text tips to the number 274637 or “CRIMES.” Students also can submit tips through the university police department’s website.
“These steps are a beginning, and we will continue to gather information and examine how we can make our university community feel as safe as possible,” Sullivan wrote in a statement Tuesday. “Let’s help each other stay safe, as we continue our search for Hannah Graham.”
Staff writer K. Burnell Evans and the Associated Press contributed to this story.
