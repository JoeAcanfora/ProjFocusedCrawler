Two horseback riders were found Monday after going missing the previous day, possibly while seeking shelter from a thunder and rain storm in the San Bernardino National Forest, authorities said.
The two women were last seen leaving the Heart Bar Campground and Wild Horse Equestrian Camp near the Highway 38 in Angelus Oaks around 10 a.m. Sunday, Randy Naquin with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said.
The women were found at the Mission Creek Preserve in Desert Hot Springs and reported to be OK, department spokeswoman Jodi Miller said just before 11 a.m. Monday.
They were located about 22 miles from the equestrian center (map), according to Google Maps of trails in the area. It was unclear how they got there.
