 Around 7 p.m. Thursday, sheriff's deputies were notified that 74-year-old Larry Baecht had gone missing while visiting the Douglas County Fair with his son. He was last seen by the goat barn. 
LAWRENCE, Kan. — After issuing a Silver Alert  for a ‘friendly and talkative’ 74-year-old man last seen at the Douglas County Fairgrounds Thursday evening, police found him on Friday at about 12:20 p.m., about three miles from the fair.
He was sitting on the motorized vehicle he typically rides. Authorities say Larry Baecht, 74, (pronounced Beck) was somewhat disoriented.
The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office and  the Kansas Highway Patrol participated in the search, using a helicopter to search heat signals  on Thursday night, but with no success.
Thankfully, he was spotted early Friday afternoon and reunited with his family at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.
Baecht was with his son at the fair and was last seen near the goat barn when he disappeared.
