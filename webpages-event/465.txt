The vehicle belonging to a pregnant woman who disappeared under suspicious circumstances from Twentynine Palms has been found, sheriff's officials said.
TheyÂ could not release the exact location for fear of compromising the investigation, said sheriff's Cpl. Randy Naquin on Wednesday, July 2, but "there was no indication of her direction of travel or current whereabouts," in the vehicle,Â a news release stated.Erin Corwin, 19, was last seenÂ Saturday morning, June 28, and was reported missing by her husband, Jonathan Wayne Corwin, the next day, officials said.
She is white, 5-foot-2, about 120 pounds with brown hair and blue eyes.Â Anyone with information about Corwinâ€™s whereabouts was asked to immediately contact investigators at 909-387-3589. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous may also call the We-Tip Hotline at 1-800-78-CRIME (782-7463) or leave information at www.wetip.com.
Officials said she left her home at 7 a.m. heading for Joshua Tree National Park and has not been seen or heard from since.
A search effort began SundayÂ andÂ continued through Wednesday in and around Joshua Tree, the news release stated.
Homicide investigators are also involved in the case.
The disappearance of Corwin, who has no history of mental illness, drug use or running away, has shocked and bewildered her family, said DeeAnna Heavilin, Corwin's brother's wife.
"She's super, super reserved, quiet, introverted," Heavilin said. "It's not really in line with her character to take off."
Corwin moved to Twentynine Palms last fall when her husband of two years, a corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, was moved from a base in Japan, she said.
Corwin's sister-in-law described the couple as having a charmed life together. They had only been living for a few months -- Corwin lived with her parents in her hometown of Oak Ridge, Tennessee, while her husband was overseas -- and the two talked about each other often -- and effusively.
"They're still in this little bubble," she said.
Corwin, who spent her free time volunteering for a nearby horse rescue, had never lived farther than a mile from her parents, with whom she has a close relationship, she said.
When she disappeared, Corwin was preparing for a visit from her mother who was comingÂ for her 20th birthday on July 15, Heavilin said.
They had bought tickets to Sea World, planned a trip to the San Diego Zoo and the young woman had stocked her freezer with extra food for her guest.
"They were looking forward to spending some time together," she said.
Corwin's mother still made the trip out to California -- her father came too -- only they are now spending most of their time with their son-in-law hoping and praying for their daughter's safe return.
"We're just keeping up the hope, keeping the faith and waiting for something to happen," Heavilin said.This story is developing.For updates, check back on this page or follow the author on TwitterÂ @PeterSurowskiÂ andÂ like him on Facebook.Heavilin has started a Facebook page to spread the word about her sister-in-law.
