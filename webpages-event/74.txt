 Hannah Elizabeth Graham 
(CNN) — Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Matthew, charging him with abduction with the intent to defile, in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said Tuesday.
Police believe Matthew was the last person with Graham before her disappearance. She was last seen Sept. 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the downtown mall.
The Charlottesville Police Department is circulating a wanted poster for the 32-year-old Matthew, who is also wanted for two counts of reckless driving.
He is described as an African American man, 6-foot-2, 270 pounds. He is known to have contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C.

Longo declined to provide additional details on the case.
“Between now and the time that this matter goes to trial, we need to be very sensitive about the information that we share,” he said.
However, the police chief stressed: “We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah.”
On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to a time line compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR.
Hannah Graham disappearance: What we know
About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday.
Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station — no one appears to be pursuing her — and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant, witnesses said.
Videos offer clues in search for missing student
The surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 a.m. The camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, WVIR reported.
At 1:20 a.m. she texted her friends to say was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR said.
Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself.
They are are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to her safe return.
Graham, 18, is a second-year student at the University of Virginia.
“Hannah is beyond precious to us,” her parents said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance. “We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It’s totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play.”

It’s partially her own fault for choosing to hang out with his type. A pretty young white girl is a championship trophy for a black thug.

Concerned about ignorance

What a dumb thing to say.  It is not her fault that someone else committed a crime against her.  Yes she could have used better judgement however it is 100% the perpetrators fault and not her fault.  Unbelievable you would make this a race thing.  It could go the opposite way that a pretty young black girl could be a championship trophy for a white thug!!!  Color/race is not a factor in this situation!

She went off with that black guy to get high and or drink more.  She got too messed up.  Then overdosed and or suffered alcohol poisoning.  He had sex with her not knowing she was deceased rather than just passed out.  Once Jesse figured out she was gone, he got rid of her body.  Either that or he wanted some sex, she said no and he went into a fit of “michael brown rage” with the same outcome of having to hide her body.
