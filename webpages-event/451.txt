SULLIVAN, Mo. (AP) — An eastern Missouri woman missing for three weeks has apparently turned up, and police say she simply left the area to start a new life elsewhere.
KMOV-TV reports that 40-year-old Becky Vaughn of the Sullivan, Missouri, area was reported missing July 8.
Vaughn left her home on July 8 with intentions of walking to a truck stop, which was four miles away. She caught a ride along the way. Her credit card was used three days later in Brazil, Indiana.
Now, police say her family has received a letter postmarked in Virginia in which she said she decided to start her life over, somewhere else. The family believes the letter is really from Vaughn.
