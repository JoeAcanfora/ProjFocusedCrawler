          Jesse Matthew Jr., a person of interest in the case of the missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile, according to Charlottesville Police.        

          Charlottesville Police        







Jesse Matthew Jr., already a "person of interest" in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, is now charged with "abduction with intent to defile," Charlottesville police said Tuesday evening. Matthew was the last person seen with 18-year-old Graham before she disappeared on Sept. 13. The two were seen together at Tempo restaurant in an area of Charlottesville known as the downtown mall between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., CNN reports.
The class 2 felony charge follows two counts of reckless driving Matthew received Saturday after he led cops on a high-speed chase in his sister's car and got away, police said.
Police seized Matthew’s own car and searched his apartment on Friday. Police say information came up leading them to search his apartment again on Monday take several articles of clothing, WVIR-TV in Charlottesville reports.
The 32-year-old Matthew is described as an African-American man, measuring 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and weighing 270 pounds. Tuesday evening he was still at large; according to police, he has contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C. He is reportedly driving his sister’s car, a light blue Nissan Sentra with Virginia plates and the tags VAC4575.
Police said they are offering a $50,000 reward for information related to Graham's disappearance. Billboards with Graham’s photo have been displayed across the state. The Outdoor Advertising Association of America donated 12 full-color digital billboards in several Virginia cities including Fredericksburg, Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Colonial Heights and Hopewell.
"We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah," Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday.
