GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) - Two young children who've been missing in suburban Maryland for more than a week are believed to be dead, police said Monday, and investigators are pursuing a homicide case against their mother.

Montgomery County police were searching parks and wooded areas in Clarksburg and Darnestown for 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle, who were last seen Sept. 7. Police also made an unusual plea to homeowners to search their own property for any sign of the children's bodies.
Their mother, 27-year-old Catherine Hoggle of Clarksburg, was arrested Friday. She's been charged with child neglect, obstruction and hindering, and police said Monday that they also plan to charge her with parental abduction.
Hoggle told investigators that her children were safe, but she wouldn't disclose their location, police said.
Police Capt. Darren Francke said homeowners in Clarksburg and Darnestown should look for anything unusual or out of place on their property, or for any strong odors. People who discover any sign of the children were advised to back away and call 911 immediately.
"We need to build the homicide case against Catherine Hoggle. Any evidence here, we do not want it to be contaminated," Francke said.
Catherine Hoggle has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Police said she had been living on the street after she slipped away from the children's father last Monday. She also altered her appearance before her arrest, police said.
