ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Alaska State Troopers are searching for a 71-year-old Missouri man who went missing after he headed out to go fishing by himself.
KTUU-TV reports the search for Jerry Warner began Sunday in the area of Willow Creek near milepost 70 of the Parks Highway.
Troopers spokeswoman Beth Ipsen says Warner and his wife have been visiting Alaska in their RV. Ipsen says Warner is an avid outdoorsman.
Theresa Dean at the Willow Creek Resort says troopers briefly suspended their search overnight but picked it up again Monday.
No hometown for Warner was immediately available.
