                    University of Virginia students on Sept. 18 held a vigil for
missing student Hannah Graham dubbed “Bring Hannah Home.” "We
will join to demonstrate our ongoing support for Hannah’s search
and loved ones,” the UVa Student Council said. “We will join to
celebrate the unyielding hope that Hannah will come back to us.”
During the event, students performed some of Graham’s favorite
music, distributed her favorite candy, pink Starbusts, and friends
shared their memories of Graham.
                










Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo 

This case is nowhere near over. We have a person in custody but there's a long road ahead of us.

GALVESTON, Texas (AP) — A man charged with abducting a missing University of Virginia sophomore has been captured in Texas and is awaiting extradition — but there is still no sign of the student, authorities said.
On Thursday morning, Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 32, appeared briefly before a Galveston County judge via a video link from jail to hear the charges against him. In Texas, he's charged with being a fugitive from justice and with giving false information to an officer, in addition to a count of abduction with intent to defile in Virginia. Judge Mark Henry held Matthew without bond on the fugitive count.
