MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Authorities say human remains discovered in a rural Tennessee county are those of a missing nursing student who disappeared from her home in April 2011.
The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Monday night that remains of Holly Bobo were found Sunday not far from her home in the town of Parsons, located about 110 miles east of Memphis.
Bobo was 20 when she disappeared. Her body was not found immediately despite extensive searches by law enforcement and volunteers.
Two men found a skull Sunday in Decatur County near property owned by the family of Zachary Adams, who has been charged with Bobo’s kidnapping and murder. He has pleaded not guilty.
A second man charged, Jason Autry, also has pleaded not guilty.
