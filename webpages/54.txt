“you have fulfilled your duty” you rule a country for 27 bloody years and you feel fulfilled.  many black people are not human beings at all.

Karma is a mutha! Blaise Campore betrayed his own very best friend Thomas Sankara that was bringing much needed change to Burkina Faso and challenged imperialism, he was overthrown & killed in the process.
To all you African leaders, your day of atonement  will come.

Change is coming to Nigeria too pretty soon. I have heard politicians say that Nigerians are too poor and lazy to force change to happen. But I see change coming to our great country.

Hahahaha. This is great. Times are changing. Power to the people. This is how it starts and the good wind would blow all through the continent and cleanse us from the vampires who call themselves rulers. Zimbabwe and Cameroon buckle up. Day of reckoning is by the corner. Let me drink wine. lillll

LMFAO!
On another note, that didn’t take very long. The military has already insinuated itself. When people pray for a revolution in Nigeria, I take God beg you, please pray that the military will never take over – even for one hour. Because we know how that one will end. Look at Africa’s history. Look at Egypt now.  Please oooo, complete your prayer when you pray
