Burkina Faso state media journalists protest censorship

 In Burkina Faso, tens of journalists from state media today
held a sit-in in front of the Ministry of Communications in the capital
Ouagadougou to protest what they deem to be excessive government censorship of
news coverage.


Journalists from the national public broadcaster Radiodiffusion Télévision du Burkina (RTB) and the
Sidwaya
stable of publications, including Burkina Information Agency (AIB), held up signs
reading "No to Censorships of Articles and Reportages In Newsrooms," "Facts are
Sacred, Comments Are Free," "We've Had Enough," along with other signs calling
for better working conditions. The protest was initiated by two independent
press unions, the Autonomous Syndicate of Information and Culture Workers
(SYNATIC) and the Association of Journalists of Burkina, according to news
reports. 
It was the first time that journalists from state-run media have
publicly broken their collective silence over what the public has long believed
to be entrenched practices of editorial direction and control by official
censors. The show of discontent was the latest in a series of recent demonstrations
by various segments of society opposing government policies and protesting the
standard of living, according to news reports.
The government tried to dismiss accusations of tampering
with news coverage after the sit-in was announced. "I have never given
directives to anybody," Communications Minister and Government Spokesman Alain
Edouard Traoré declared at a press
conference on Monday, according to RTB. He said the station "operates in
total independence" from his office. "We do not constitute a ministry of propaganda," private news site Burkina 24
quoted him as saying.
When pressed, the minister acknowledged that state media
receives what he termed "guidance" from the government, Burkina 24 reported. Traoré declined to elaborate. "It's not good
to relay a number of things we do to remind a certain number of things [to
journalists]. We don't want violence on television," he told the press
conference. A  September 2011 white
paper from the ministry on government communication policy noted the
"excessive use" of state television "as a medium of communication of
institutional image," and that within state media, there is a "poor
understanding of the status of public service bodies."
"Sometimes, they give directives to the director or the
editor-in-chief who act as censors. Sometimes, it's the zeal from the
editor-in-chief," according to Sidiki Dramé, a sportscaster with state radio
and spokesman for the SYNATIC press union. "We are not going to make things up
anyway. It has become exaggerated, that's why we are shouting that we are fed
up," he told CPJ. For instance, the protesters charge that an official of the communication
ministry stormed RTB's studios to oversee the final cut of a report on an anti-government
march on June 29.  They claim that the
report was cut substantially and an interview with opposition leader Zéphirin
Diabré was removed. 
RTB's favorable coverage of the government has also made it
more difficult for its reporters to cover anti-government protests, according
to Dramé. Several RTB journalists have been intimidated or assaulted at
protests based on the perception of the station's pro-government bent.  Other acts of intimidation may go unreported.

"Censorship is a useless thing in a democracy," Burkina 24 quoted Traoré as saying. But
Burkina Faso's democratic credentials are questionable. While President Blaise
Compaoré plays a leading role in mediation efforts in response to political
crises, coups, and other conflicts troubling West Africa, he has maintained a
tight grip on power during his 26-year reign. After seizing control in a bloody
coup in 1987, Compaoré swept four elections with an average of 86% of the vote.
His critics have sometimes ended up dead. For example, eminent
investigative journalist Norbert
Zongo was murdered
in December 1998 while he was reporting on the torture and murder of a driver
of the president's brother. In 2006, a judge dropped the murder case without a
single conviction. Every December, friends and colleagues of Zongo commemorate his killing
by, among other things, buying air time to broadcast infomercials calling for
justice. To date, the
state broadcaster has never allowed such infomercials to air, according to
local journalists.
"You cannot block information today, in the 21st century. We
will continue our struggle. Public opinion supports us," Dramé said. The
journalists have vowed to pursue talks with the authorities until their demands
for more independence, as well as better pay, equipment, and insurance, are
met.
