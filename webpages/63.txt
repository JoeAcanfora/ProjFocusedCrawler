Protesters Set Fire to Burkina Faso Parliament
30.10.2014  at 6:44 pm By BellaNaija.com 22 Comments 
Protesters in Burkina Faso have set the parliament ablaze as they are enraged over the government’s plans to let their president extend his 27-year rule.
Members of parliament were trying to change the constitution so that President Blaise Compaore, who has been ruling the country since 1987, to stand for re-election again next year, BBC reports.
However, the country’s citizens are not happy with that idea, and have set fire to parliament, the city hall, and the headquarters of the ruling party.
As of the time of this report, the protesters are marching towards the presidential palace, and Burkina Faso’s airport has been shut down.
Five people have died in the course of the protests.

Power to the people.  27 years is too long to have an incompetent leader. It’s to kick him out.

WHAT!!!. 27 year rule.  he has been the president for a whoke 27 yesrs no shaking.
pls they should catch that predident and kill him immediately. 
black man is not capable of ruling themselves. the greed and wickedness in a black man’s heart is astronomical. Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world,

Plus we all need to remove the cloud blocking our eyes (and memories) say NO to Buhari 2015!
Imagine Abacha being alive and saying he wants to come rule again.
Buhari’s atrocities weren’t just as popular.
We need to move past sentiments as a country. It’s the only way we can move forward

a new dawn in Burkina Faso………. I hear some 30 people have been shot dead. I hope the President learns from the lot of Gbagbo and Mubarak and many others who thought they could do anything they wanted until their citizens and the ICC decided that NO, U CANT.

Campaore took the best decision and resigned. Now the country will be free to establishe its transitional processes and grow.  The presidency is not an inheritance for anyone.

It is  interesting to observe the trend in other countries too. Cameroon, Zimbabwe… It is indeed an African problem. One that must be addressed. The youths of today are of a different brand. Leaders must do things right to avoid being flung out by their sons and daughters.
