Burkina Faso’s deposed president has fled to neighbouring Ivory Coast after being ousted in a popular uprising, while the military appears to have averted a dangerous power struggle by backing a largely unknown colonel as interim leader.
The president, Blaise Compaoré, his family and entourage have been taken in by Ivory Coast, according to a statement from the office of its president, Alassane Ouattara, who is following events “with particular attention”.
A resident of the Ivorian capital, Yamoussoukro, told Agence France-Presse he saw a cortege of around 30 cars heading for a luxury hotel which is also used as a semi-official residence for foreign dignitaries.
“The services of the President hotel in Yamoussoukro served him [Compaoré] dinner yesterday and breakfast this morning,” a hotel employee was quoted as saying.
But on Saturday a member of staff at the President hotel, who gave his name as Daniel, said: “He is not staying here. We have all heard from the newspapers that he is in Yamoussoukro but we have not seen him.”
Compaoré, 63, resigned on Friday after days of violent protests demanding an end to his regime. His swift departure after 27 years in power created a potential power vacuum in the impoverished west African nation.
The leader of a group of young army officers, Isaac Zida, became interim leader. “Lieutenant-colonel Isaac Zida was chosen to lead the transition period opened after the departure of President Compaoré,” said a statement published after a meeting of army chiefs.
Zida’s appointment was unanimous, the army said. “The period of transition” and its “form and duration will be determined later,” said the declaration, which was drafted and signed after senior officers met with the joint chief of staff on Saturday.
The text was signed by General Navere Honore Traore, who initially said he would himself assume power, a claim Zida had dismissed as “obsolete”. Many protesters objected to Traore as leader because he is seen as a Compaoré loyalist.
Although Zida, the second in command of the presidential guard, could face similar criticism, analysts believe he is more appealing to the younger generation and civil society. He appeared before big crowds alongside the lawyer Guy Hervé Kam, leader of the Citizen Broom group that helped lead the demonstrations.
Zida’s appointment may also be acknowledgement of the need to retain the support of the presidential guard, an elite military unit of around 1,500 troops who are better armed and better trained than the conventional army.
Dressed in military fatigues, Zida announced on television early on Saturday that he had assumed “the responsibilities of head of the transition and of head of state” to ensure a “smooth democratic transition”. He said “the aspirations for democratic change” of the Burkina youth “will be neither betrayed, nor disappointed”.
Zida also said the ousted president was “in a safe place” and his “safety and wellbeing are assured”. He called on the international community including the African Union to “support our people during this difficult ordeal”. He announced that the country’s borders had been closed, a transitional committee had been set up and the constitution had been suspended.
A coalition of opposition parties and civil society organisations rejected the army’s takeover of power and said they would take to the streets in protest on Sunday.
“The political opposition and civil society organisations reaffirm that the victory from the popular uprising – and consequently the management of the transition – belongs to the people and should not in any way be confiscated by the army,” they said in a statement issued after talks on Saturday.
“Our consultation reaffirmed that this transition should be democratic and civilian in character,” it said.
Calm returned to the streets of the capital, Ouagadougou, on Saturday, with shops reopening and calls by protest organisers for a clean-up of the debris left behind after an explosive week in which half a million people marched, stormed and torched parliament and other buildings and gathered at the presidential palace to demand Compaoré’s departure.

A western diplomat based in Ouagadougou said: “It’s done. It’s over. It’s extraordinary. I’ve been driving around this morning and there is sweeping up going on all over town. The same adults and children who were going out demonstrating are now out with dustpan and broom. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
He added: “In 24 hours it seems to have gone right back. Small businesses have reopened everywhere. It’s nearly a normal Saturday except the supermarkets are closed and there’s a certain euphoria in the air.”
The diplomat, who did not wish to be named, said the burned and looted headquarters of Compaoré’s ruling party, and the home of his “universally loathed” younger brother François, were now attracting crowds of curious onlookers, almost like tourist attractions. “They have come to see if it’s really true.”
The uprising, which has drawn parallels with the Arab spring, was sparked by plans to change the constitution to allow Compaoré to stand once again for elections next year. He initially rejected calls to resign but gave in as the scale of the unrest became clear.
Burkina Faso hosts French special forces and serves as an important ally of both France and the US in the fight against Islamist militants in west Africa. Washington called on Burkina Faso’s military to follow “the constitutionally mandated process for the transfer of power and holding of democratic elections”.
The state department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, said: “We condemn any attempts by the military or other parties to take advantage of the situation for unconstitutional gain and call on all parties to respect the people’s support for the democratic process.”
