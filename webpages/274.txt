From Burkina Faso, Under the Acacias has aGorom-Gorom Flooding Update – 23 August

Things are happening quite quickly, now thankfully. Because of the delay in being able to collect the money, our distribution has been put back to Friday. But this will work well, as we are co-ordinating with Christian Aid and others who are doing similar distributions on Monday and today, Wednesday, to ensure that everyone in need is covered.
Members of my home church, Glenwood Church, have made a very generous contribution to the work, and Samaritan's Purse and Food for the Hungry are also supporting us in our efforts.

George Ngwane says: Africa’s Development Problematique (The case of NEPAD)
In July 2001, during the Organisation of African Union summit in Lusaka, Zambia, the New African Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) was born. Five years later and given the importance of this new economic paradigm to Africans, it is necessary to revisit and restate some of the predicaments that NEPAD inadvertently put on its way.
First, the ideological problem.  NEPAD was not necessary. The Lagos Plan of Action (LPA) that was adopted in the extraordinary OAU – summit in 1980 was a promissory note for which Africa’s economic development was to be improved between 1980 and 2000.
Home of the mandinmories addresses Gambian politicians: Stop it already…
Albert Einstein once said “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results”. Think about this quote for a second and ask yourself, does the series of letters exchanged between UDP/NRP alliance and NADD bring them any closer to forming a viable and united front against the APRC? Instead what it has generated into is a oneupmanship between the two alliance leaders. One concludes his missive with the line: in the service of the truth and the other uses: in the service of the nation. No kidding. What is this in the service line all about. Sincerely will do just fine, but what do I know. This is a contest in letters between a sociologist and a barrister and little people like me will not understand. But if I read one more time another one of those lines, I swear I will puke.
