History
 Burkina Faso: The Tale of Two Anniversaries

Africa Flak discusses the tale of two anniversaries in Burkina Faso: “No matter how Compaore celebrated, the 20th anniversary was always going to sensitive and emotional. Compaore came to power through a coup that struck down and killed his brother-in-arm Tomas Sankara, a populist politician who towards the end of his mandate had become increasingly distant and paranoid, not even speaking to his inner cabinet.”

 Fighting the desert in Burkina Faso

Vive la francophonie posts an article about the Koom la viim association's efforts to fight desertification (Fr) in Burkina Faso by planting 3,500 plants. “This initiative deserves to be known…even if it only concerns a small portion of land, these efforts contribute to cleaning and reoxygenating our planet…if thousands of projects like these are started, the earth will be made more beautiful.”

 African Journalists on Franco-African Relations

African journalists working in France are calling on the two remaining French presidential candidates, Nicolas Sarkozy and Segolene Royal, to begin a new chapter in Franco-African relations (Fr), according to the blog of the Alliance for Democratic Progress.  “We have to reconsider everything, make a fresh start, a sort of “big bang,” so that France stops treating us like children.  Africa must be a partner.” (Fr)

 Burkina Faso: starting a primary school

Keith blogs about education in Burkina Faso: “We are also looking at the possibility of starting a primary school in the region, and I will let you know as things progress.

 Burkina Faso: You census people are evil!

A conversation showing mistrust of census in Burkina Faso from Voices in the Desert: It was Samba who started the argument. He downed his shot-glass of tea (traditionally ‘bitter like death’) and turned to Idi. ‘Onon yimbe resonsmon mbooda,’ he declared. ‘You census people are evil.’
Idrissa looked hurt. ‘Why do you say that?’

 Africa, France: Suing African Leaders for Embezzlement

Demain le Congo Brazzaville posts [Fr] a complaint lodged in the French accusing of embezzlement African leaders such as  Omar Bongo of Gabon, Denis Sassoun Nguesso of Congo-Brazzaville and Blaise Compaoré  of Burkina Faso. The complaint acknowledges that a French judge cannot adjudicate on salaries of African dictators but emphasizes the massive amounts of real estate owned by the accused African leaders in France.
