MONTREAL — Winmalo Somda immigrated to Canada from his native Burkina Faso just six years ago, but already he had made a deep impression in his new home.
“He was truly an exemplary student. You’d love to have a class full of people like him,” Guy Gauthier, one of his engineering professors at Montreal’s École de technologie supérieure, said Friday. “He was very hardworking, but he was endearing too, always smiling and positive. When I heard the news last night, I cried for a long time. He was really someone special.”

Mr. Somda was among the 116 passengers and crew aboard Air Algérie Flight 5017, which crashed in the desert of southern Mali early Thursday. He, his wife Angélique Kpoda and their two children Nathanael and Arielle, were en route home to Montreal after attending a family celebration in Burkina Faso. Mr. Somda’s younger brother Wilfried was also aboard the flight, as was a family friend, Isabelle Prévost of Sherbrooke, Que.
The crash has devastated Quebec’s Burkinabé community, which on Friday posted a list on its web site of 11 people aboard the flight who were headed to the province. Some were visiting family in Canada, while others like the Somdas lived here.
Mamadou Zoungrana, a hospital technician in Gatineau, Que., came to Canada in 2012 to build a life so his wife and two sons could join him. The reunion was set for Thursday, and he had prepared his apartment and chosen schools for the boys. But there was grief instead of joy when Mr. Zoungrana learned that the plane carrying Rabdou Salimata Zoungrana and their sons Brice and Arsene, aged six and 13, had crashed.
The Association des Burkinabé du Grand Montréal reported that another Quebecer, Bassirou Yameogo of Jonquière lost his wife and son in the crash, while Moïse Sandwidi of Quebec City lost his mother.

Hubert Salomon last saw his friend Winmalo Somda on July 15. Mr. Somda was flying out that evening for Burkina Faso to attend his parents’ 50th wedding anniversary party, but first wanted to see his newborn goddaughter, Mr. Salomon’s daughter Kayla.
The two men became friends while studying together at ETS, and Mr. Salomon said it hit him hard when he realized Thursday night that Mr. Somda was on the ill-fated flight. “They were really a beautiful family,” he said. Mr. Somda was a great talker, full of stories about life back in Africa, and had a playful sense of humour.
“When something bad happened, he always tried to take it with a grain of salt. He was not the type to get discouraged,” he said. In April, he had begun working as a project engineer for Maibec, a wood products company in Saint-Pamphile, southeast of Quebec City, which meant driving home every weekend to be with his family. They had planned to move closer to Saint-Pamphile this weekend. “It’s terribly sad, a real tragedy,” said Sylvain Naud, who hired Mr. Somda at Maibec. “He was really appreciated by his co-workers, and we are truly going to miss him.”

His younger brother Wilfried had come to Canada in late 2012 and studied video technology at a private college in Montreal. He hosted a travel show on a community radio station and worked in marketing. He leaves behind a wife and three-year-old daughter. His wife Rita Sanhouidi did not join the trip to Burkina Faso because she is expecting their second child any day.
She told the TVA network that his loss will sink in when she is expecting him home from work in the evening and he does not arrive. “My daughter is going to start to ask why Papa isn’t there to give her a kiss and read her a story before she goes to sleep,” Ms. Sanhouidi said. “I will have to use all my strength to support them, do everything for the one who is coming who will not know his father. . . . I will do everything so he can be like him, because he was a generous man, a really, really good man.”
The Somda family’s warmth led to lasting friendship with Isabelle Prévost, who was a neighbour when they lived in Sherbrooke after they first arrived in Canada. “She met them by chance, saw them on the street and started talking,” her husband Danny Frappier told Radio-Canada. “She liked discovering other cultures and was always interested by the people around her.”
Ms. Prévost, a mother of three who was very active in her community, had never flown before, but last week after months of planning and anticipation she joined the Somdas on their trip to Burkina Faso. Just before boarding the Air Algérie flight she phoned home to assure her family it had been a fantastic trip.
