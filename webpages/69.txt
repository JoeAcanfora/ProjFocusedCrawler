          Protesters stormed parliament in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, on Thursday, before setting it on fire in protest at plans to change the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaore to extend his 27-year rule. Police had fired tear gas on protesters to try to prevent them from moving in on the National Assembly building ahead of a vote on the controversial legislation.

Burkina Faso’s army seized power on Thursday after protesters burned government buildings in anger over President 









        Blaise Compaore



      ’s plan to extend his 27-year rule. The landlocked nation had been one of the most stable in tumultuous West Africa, until the army declared Mr. Compaore’s government dissolved. It said it would stage elections within a year, in a statement stamped and signed by Gen. 









        Honoré Nabéré Traoré.



       Elections had already been planned for next year, but 63-year-old Mr. Compaore—who has served four terms—had asked Parliament to approve a law on Thursday that would have given him free rein to seek a fifth. Instead, young men set fire to the national assembly, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported. Then they burned down the city hall, the ruling party’s headquarters, and stormed the presidency. 




Burkina Faso’s capital was plunged into disarray Thursday as protesters burned government buildings and stormed the presidential estate.

Television footage shown by private channel Africable showed thousands of mostly young men blaring motorcycle horns, burning tires and blowing vuvuzelas. Security forces fired at some of them, killing three, Reuters reported. Mr. Compaore spent much of the day inside his presidential palace in the capital Ouagadougou, trying to negotiate with his military, said a member of his entourage.  Early in the afternoon, he dropped his fifth-term proposal, but protests continued.  Late Thursday evening, he proclaimed his refusal to step down, Radio France International reported him as saying. One group of young men stormed the state television station, dancing around an anchorman’s desk, in photographs captured by Reuters. “He thinks he’s in control of the situation, but the army is in the process of consulting itself about that,” the person close to Mr. Compaore said. The chaos in the normally sleepy, sun-baked capital was indicative of how Africa’s increasingly young and urban population is driving out aging leaders. Most of the country’s 17 million people aren’t yet 18, and don’t remember when Mr. Compaore first took power in a 1987 coup. Under Mr. Compaore’s rule, Burkina Faso has been the picture of a kind of a democracy that has taken hold in several of Africa’s leading states, among them Uganda, Cameroon, Gabon and Nigeria, where President 









        Goodluck Jonathan



       is expected to easily win a second term next year.

Elections have been frequent, and broadly seen as fair, but dominated by the ruling party. Village elders have endorsed incumbent leaders for fear of losing out on patronage if they support the opposition. Local media have been free and widely consumed, but have also given generous space to the government, which pays reporters to cover its news conferences. It is a system that is coming under strain as waves of young people flock to cities and find frustration over the scarcity of jobs.  In Senegal, protests in 2012 led by local rappers helped deny 85-year-old President 









        Abdoulaye Wade



       a third term. In Burkina Faso, the sudden undoing of Mr. Compaore’s three-decade-long rule posed difficult questions for Western diplomats. Burkina Faso under Mr. Compaore’s stewardship was one of the few countries in this region that hadn’t recently suffered a coup, a civil war, or both. There have been no occurrences of Ebola here, either, even as cases have snuck into next-door Mali, and into nearby Senegal and Nigeria. For months, diplomats tried to persuade Mr. Compaore to abandon his re-election campaign. The U.S. State Department in particular publicly condemned the fifth-term proposal, and the White House repeated as much on Thursday. “We call on all parties, including the security forces, to end the violence and return to a peaceful process to create a future for Burkina Faso that will build on Burkina Faso’s hard-won democratic gains,” National Security Council spokeswoman 









        Bernadette Meehan



       said. More privately, U.S. diplomats have tried to leverage their $480 million aid package from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account, which is awarded for good governance, telling Mr. Compaore that his country wouldn’t qualify for a second package if he continued to pursue a fifth term. And yet Mr. Compaore appeared unfazed, said one U.S. State Department official. “He ends up changing the conversation to ‘You want democracy, right? Well, we have our ways and you have yours,’ ” recalled the official. “He would say, ‘Even you needed strong people back when your country was being established. How can you impose this on us?’ ” During Mr. Campoare’s rule, Burkina Faso has been a nation at the crossroads of two great trends sweeping Africa.

Its northern neighbors, Mali and Niger, are battling a rising tide of Islamic militants, as are nearby Nigeria and Mauritania. But southern neighbors Ivory Coast and Ghana are busy paving new highways and ports to keep up with an exploding consumer class. Mr. Compaore’s country has neither seen the explosive growth of its southern neighbors nor the recurrent conflict to the north. Instead, a quieter change has swept this country: Under Mr. Compaore’s rule, it transformed from an agrarian to an urban society. Ouagadougou is the fastest-growing city in Africa, according to a 2010 United Nations report. It is swelling by 12,500 people a month, that report said, many of whom grow up to sell phone cards, used clothes or snacks in the street. Just 5% of those who have reached working age have a full-time job, according to a Gallup poll conducted last year. Still, on the world stage, Mr. Compaore has been a steadfast ally to France, the country’s former colonizer. In August, he traveled to Washington, briefing American officials on his efforts to negotiate peace in northern Mali, the scene of a simmering, Islamist-tinged rebellion. “A lot of people are going to be shaking their heads after this and wondering what happened,” said

 Obama should take note, regarding his dreams of a third term.

“[mr. compaore] would say, ‘Even you needed strong people back when your country was being established. How can you impose this on us?’ ” the question should be how can you impose your rule again on citizens.   the US and the rest of the world no longer live in the 18th and 19th centuries. equal rights, freedom and democracy should be universal by now, even if they were not a few decades or centuries ago.   do your country a favor, mr. compaore, and find a graceful exit.  be an upright person.

We hold these
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness…that whenever any form of government
becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to
abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most
likely to effect their safety and happiness.
--Declaration of
Independence

Hmmm. I wonder if we could learn from this example.
