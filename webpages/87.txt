          Protesters stormed parliament in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, on Thursday, before setting it on fire in protest at plans to change the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaore to extend his 27-year rule. Police had fired tear gas on protesters to try to prevent them from moving in on the National Assembly building ahead of a vote on the controversial legislation.
