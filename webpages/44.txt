After two days of protests in Burkina Faso the president, Blaise Compaoré, has reportedly abandoned plans to amend the constitution to allow himself a further three terms in office.
Followed on Twitter by journalists and protestors, and with live reports streaming on Radio Omega FM Ouaga’s online station, this “revolution 2.0” has been called a victory by the Burkinabè opposition. 
 Communications minister, Alain Edouard Traore, announced the move in a hurried statement after the parliament, national TV and radio buildings were stormed, and statues were toppled in the country’s second largest city, Bobo Dioulasso.

At 12.15pm, Compaoré took to Twitter to appeal for “calm and serenity” as protests continued to rage outside government buildings.

French media also reported that the president’s brother was arrested as he tried to flee the country, and statements by the army’s Général Kouamé Lougué have fuelled speculation that the army are poised to remove Compaoré from power. 
At 1.40pm Reuters photojournalist Joe Penney tweeted: “People marching towards presidency led by General Kwamé Lougé. About to meet presidential guard loyal to Blaise. Final assault #burkina.”

Compaoré, 63, has been president for 27 years since seizing power in a military coup in 1987.

Despite already being reported as a victory for the Burkinabè people against Compaoré’s “constitutional coup d’etat”, protesters say they continue to face rounds of live ammunition from the security forces even after the announcement, as governments buildings continue to burn:

On Twitter, journalists and protesters have been following events using the #lwili hashtag, named after the traditional Burkinabè Lwili Peendé cloth being worn by many in the protests.
Now dubbed Burkina’s “revolution 2.0”, a reference also to the country’s popular movement led by Thomas Sankara in 1983, the announcement suggests a promising break with the trend set by various African rulers finding elasticity in constitutional limits, including Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Namibia, Togo and Uganda. 
Commentators have also been linking Burkina Faso’s protests to a wider recent history of revolution and unrest. Opposition activist Emile Pargui Pare told the AFP news agency: “October 30 is Burkina Faso’s Black Spring, like the Arab Spring.”

Protesters storm key buildings in the capital 
Reports continue of fighting in the capital, and images emerge from inside the state TV station, stormed by protesters earlier today.

Général Kouamé Lougué has also delayed his statement by over two hours, leaving protestors and observers unsure of the military’s aims.

If Blaise does go, look forward to how it's presented + how nimbly Paris and Washington dance around usage of word 'coup' #BurkinaFaso

Authorities at Dakar airport have also apparently confirmed that Compaoré arrived in Senegal this afternoon after fleeing the country. 
Update 5.43pm
Earlier reports that Compaoré had fled the country now seem false, after the president makes an announcement on a local FM frequency.

The opposition leader Zéphirin Diabré has tweeted “We totally oppose a coup in #Burkina #Faso . We must remain democratic. #lwili # bf226” in response to fears that the military are poised to take power.

State of emergency declared
A communique read on Radio Omega at 5pm says Compaoré has “dissolved government”, declared a state of emergency, and has made an appeal to the opposition leaders and to the public to end the protests and “stay calm”.
Here is a text of the address, as reported by Reuters and the BBC:
“A state of emergency is declared across the national territory. The chief of the armed forces is in charge of implementing this decision which enters into effect today. I dissolve the government from today so as to create conditions for change. I’m calling on the leaders of the political opposition to put an end to the protests. I’m pledging from today to open talks with all the actors to end the crisis.”
