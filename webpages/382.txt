Protesters break into Burkina Faso Parliament 







The rally did not attract as many people as had been expected, with some representatives of the opposition and civil society saying there was no need to demonstrate before they had discussed the transition with the army.Organizers of the rally had said the transition belonged to the people and should not be "confiscated" by the army.Zephirin Diabre, president of the main opposition party Union for Progress and Change (UPC), told protesters civilians should play an important role during the period before elections are held in three months' time.Isaac Zida, second-in-command of the presidential guard, was chosen as president by the army to oversee the transition on Saturday. Army chief Honore Traore, who had initially proclaimed himself head of state, gave his backing to Zida.Zida announced a reopening of the frontiers of the West African country, which was engulfed by demonstrations demanding that Compaore resign this week.At least three people were killed in clashes with security forces in Ouagadougou, where protesters set fire to parliament.The protesters opposed plans by Compaore - in power since 1987 - to introduce a constitutional amendment that would have allowed him to seek a fifth term.The president fled to Ivory Coast on Friday.The African Union and the United States called for a civilian-led transition.Zida was until now an almost unknown figure to the public, unlike Traore, whom many protesters rejected as president because his ascension in the military had taken place under Compaore.Compaore's critics accused him of monopolizing economic power and of offering no future to young people, who make up 60 per cent of the 17-million population.Burkina Faso's per capita income was only 670 dollars last year, according to the African Development Bank, with the economy based mainly on agriculture.
