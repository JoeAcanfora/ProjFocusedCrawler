Visitors to Burkina Faso are guaranteed to see some unusual sights, such as the giant egg-shaped rocks near Banfora or the 'tame' crocodiles found in lakes like the one at Sabou. The country's culture and architecture are also distinctive, as you'll see if you take a look round some of the interesting places to visit.


Gorom-Gorom

Gorom-Gorom is known for its colourful markets selling a range of goods. The town also acts as a staging post for camel treks into the dramatic desert landscapes of the north.

Agriculture & Famine

A quarter of the population of sub-Saharan Africa is undernourished and famines can impact whole regions.
Land is available to grow more food locally, but investment is needed in  technologies such as irrigation for land to be used effectively. Farmers must also adapt to climate change if they are to feed the continent's rising population.

Ouagadougou

The capital of Burkina Faso is home to 1.9 million people. Adding to the everyday bustle, the city attracts visitors throughout the year to its many arts festivals. Respite from the busy streets can be found in one of the city’s many gardens and outdoor bars.

Foods

Africa has some of the most distinctive cuisines and flavours in the world. Food varies widely, but there are commonalities across regions. Depending on what's grown locally, dishes are also influenced by the traders, immigrants and rulers who settled across the continent. Arab, Asian and European elements blend in with traditional African cooking.

Nazinga Game Ranch

Located near Pô, the Nazinga Game ranch has around 800 elephants across a  fairly small park, so the animals are quite easy to find.

Bobo-Dioulasso

Bobo-Dioulasso is Burkina’s second city and is known as the country's capital of live music. Music is a central part of the culture here and most people in Bobo play at least one local instrument.

Po (Pô), Kassena country

In the villages east of Po, the houses of Kassena country are famous for their patterned walls, decorated with strong geometric designs.

Games & Sport

Africa is home to arguably the oldest-recorded games and sports. While some are only known through archaeology, modern-day games and sports such as Mancala/Mankala and  Nubian wrestling are very much alive today.
Of course, new sports have come along to claim the attention of  Africans. You may have heard of one - it's called football.

Volta rivers

The Volta basin has three rivers – the Black Volta (Mouhoun), Red Volta (Nazinon) and White Volta (Nakanbe) which run through the central and western half of Burkina. Home to the upper courses of these rivers, Burkina used to be called ‘Upper Volta’.

Banfora, Domes de Fabedougou

Around 20 minutes outside the town of Banfora are the Domes de Fabedougou. These unusual geological formations, which look like giant eggs of craggy rock, date back 1.8 billion years.

Ouahigouya

The largest town in the north is Ouahigouya. Though this used to be an ancient seat of power, it is now a humble market town, best known for the vultures which perch along the trees and rooftops of its streets.

Health

Africa has a high number of communicable diseases, which place a huge burden on healthcare systems. The vast majority of malaria cases and HIV/AIDS-related deaths occur in Africa; these two diseases currently represent the greatest threats.
With low investment in healthcare and a severe shortage of medical staff, many countries struggle to meet the health needs of their people.

History

The first humans are thought to have lived in Africa and powerful African empires formed from the medieval age onwards.
However, today's African nations were shaped by the European powers who colonised this vast continent. Having gained their independence, many African countries are still coming to terms with the legacy left by their colonisers.

W National Park

Covering more than 14,000 square km (across 3 countries), the ‘W’ is one of Africa’s premier conservation areas. Home to over 30 species of mammal and 350 species of bird, the park has been described as “one of the great places of the planet” for wildlife enthusiasts.

Climate

Africa is a massive continent, with a range of climates. Some  regions are hot and dry, like the Sahara, Kalahari and Namib  deserts. Other parts are wet or covered in tropical  rainforest. Conditions also vary by altitude, from the dry salt pans of  the Danakil Depression (one of   the lowest points on earth) to the snowcaps (at certain times) of the highest mountains.  Weather-wise, Africa has it all!

Poverty

Across the rest of the world, absolute poverty has halved over recent decades, but in Africa it has barely fallen.
About two-fifths of the population of sub-Saharan Africa survive week by week on what someone in the UK earns from just one hour's work on the minimum wage.

Sabou

At the Sabou lake, crocodiles can be approached within a few metres. Some visitors even sit on the animals. Fed on a diet of chickens, the crocodiles are well-used to people. Thought to share the same spirit as humans, crocodiles are considered sacred in Burkina Faso. 'Tame' crocodiles can therefore be found at some other places too, such as a lake at Tanghin-Dassouri southwest of Ouagadougou.

Tenkodogo

Tenkodogo is the ancient capital of the Mossi (‘Tenga’ = land, ‘Kodogo’ =  old) people. The genealogy of the many Mossi kings is recounted by  storytellers and singers (known as griots) during the Muslim festival of Tabaski. But if you don’t like the sight of blood, be sure to avoid the three days of this festival (more commonly known as Eid-ul-Adha).  At this time, Muslims slaughter animals to honour the Abraham story,  when God commanded a sheep should be sacrificed instead of Abraham’s  son.

Children

Around one in six children born in sub-Saharan Africa don't live to see their fifth birthday and life can be tough for those who do.
What are the common challenges facing African children and how do their lives compare with those of children in the UK?

Development

‘People are the real wealth of a nation.’ This is the belief of the United Nations, whose Millenium Development Goals provide a framework for improving the lives of millions.
It helps when nations are peaceful, stable and growing economically. But where even the poorest countries focus on health, education and creating fairer societies, more Africans have the chance of a better life.

Geography & Wildlife

With its varied geography and diverse habits, the African continent is  home to a wide range of flora and fauna. Though famous for its 'big  game' animals, Africa has huge numbers of fish, mammal, bird, reptile,  amphibian and insect species, as well as many tree, plant and flower  species.

Women

A woman’s status varies by country and region across Africa. In many parts, women struggle against inequality in laws, education, pay and domestic responsibilities.
Women’s health is also at risk from traditional practices such as early marriage. But with better education, girls can make more informed choices, leading to the greater development of African nations.
