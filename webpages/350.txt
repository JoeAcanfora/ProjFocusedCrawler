Protesters have stormed Burkina Faso’s parliament and set its main chamber ablaze in the most significant challenge ever to the President’s 27-year rule in one of the world’s poorest countries.








At least three protesters were shot dead and scores were wounded by security forces as the vast crowd tried to storm the home of the President’s brother and overran other state buildings. It was not possible to confirm the whereabouts of President Blaise Compaoré, who seized power in 1987.The country’s military announced emergency measures, including the formation of a transitional government, after a day of violent protests which culminated in the imposition of an overnight curfew.Opposition leaders said they had held talks with retired General Kouame Lougue, a former defence minister, about dissolving the national assembly and creating the new transitional government. General Lougue was then seen marching with supporters towards the presidential palace.It is not known who will lead the interim administration.President Compaoré declared a state of emergency and pledged to open talks with the opposition, local radio reported. “I dissolve the government from today so as to create conditions for change. I’m calling on the leaders of the political opposition to put an end to the protests,” said a presenter on Radio Omega FM as he read a supposed statement from President Compaoré.The demonstrators had wanted to block a vote in parliament that would have allowed President Compaoré to seek a fifth term. State television and radio went off air.Demonstrators shouted, “It is over for the regime” and “We do not want him again”, when they heard that the vote on term limits had been stopped. Flames enveloped the main building in the parliament complex, and many members of parliament fled to a nearby hotel.

“It is difficult to say what happens next, but things are out of control because the demonstrators do not listen to anyone,” said Ablassé Ouedraogo, an opposition MP.In a bid to restore calm, military leaders met with the influential traditional chief of the country’s largest ethnic group, the Mossi.Burkina Faso has long been known for its relative stability in volatile West Africa, although tensions have been mounting over Mr Compaoré’s plans to extend his rule. The President has been elected four times since the coup in 1987, though the opposition has disputed the results. Crowds also attacked the homes of government ministers and looted shops in the country’s second-largest city, Bobo-Dioulasso.Earlier, police had pushed the crowds back with tear gas, but they regrouped in larger numbers, surged past police lines and broke into the parliament building.Since coming to power, President Compaoré, 63, has refashioned himself as an elder statesman who brokered electoral disputes and hostage releases. He made no secret of his support for Charles Taylor, the Liberian warlord turned President now serving a 50-year sentence for war crimes.He has also been accused of supporting rebel groups in Ivory Coast and Angola, though he later played peacemaker in Ivory Coast.More recently, his government helped negotiate the release of several European hostages held in Mali.AP/Reuters
