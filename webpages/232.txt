Happy hippos
 
Awouah takes a trip to Lake Bala, where she talks to the local fishermen and looks out for one of the lake's residents. 
One of the fishermen tells her he stays overnight at the lake, when the fishing is good. Find out what types of fish he catches.
But the main reason Awouah wanted to come to the lake is to see her favourite animal – the hippo. Awouah does a really good impression of the noise the hippos make when they blow water out of their air-holes.
The hippos in Lake Bala look very content and peaceful swimming through the waters. But on land, they can be very dangerous. Find out why in Geography and Wildlife.
