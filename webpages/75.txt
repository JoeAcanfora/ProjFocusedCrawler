"Dozens of soldiers have reportedly joined the protests, including former defense minister, General Kouame Lougue. The main opposition leader, Zephirin Diabre, has called on the military to side with ‘the people’," the BBC reported.
The "civil disobedience campaign" led by President Compaore's opposition started on October 28, 2014 after the government asked the National Assembly to hold a referendum aimed at legalizing Compaore's re-election next year. The protesters oppose the President’s attempts to extend his 27-year rule by changing the constitution of Burkina Faso.
Burkina Faso, formerly known as the Republic of Upper Volta, had been a French colony since the end of the 19th century till it gained independence in 1960. The French government addressed Compareo urging him to abide by the African Union principle prohibiting leaders to change the law in order to stay in power.
"The African Union charter on democracy and good governance article 23 ... specifies clearly that constitutional revisions aiming to prevent political change are banned," said Foreign ministry spokesman Romain Nadal, as cited by Reuters, adding that the charter violation would apparently lead to sanctions.
"Both France and the European Union (EU) have called on him [Compaore] to scrap the proposed constitutional amendment. The EU said it could jeopardize Burkina Faso's stability. The US has also raised concern about the proposed amendment," the BBC reported.
Compaore had seized power in Burkina Faso in 1987 during a coup and has since repeatedly won the presidential elections. In 2011, Burkina Faso's leader was unexpectedly faced with army protests. The decision to hold the referendum in 2014 has only aggravated tensions in the country.
The peaceful protest in Ouagadougou has brought together tens of thousands, but has escalated into violent clashes with government security forces. On October 30, protesters breached the security cordon and set fire to the parliament building and the ruling party headquarters; five people had been killed during the skirmish.
"October 30 is Burkina Faso's Black Spring, like the Arab Spring," said opposition activist Emile Pargui Pare, as cited by Agence France-Presse.
Burkina Faso's state television has gone off air and the president's whereabouts are unknown, the BBC underscores, adding that the leader is still communicating with the public via Twitter.Add to blogSend to friendShareAdd to blogYou may place this material on your blog by copying the link.Publication code:Burkina Faso Protesters Set Fire to Parliament Against Leader's Attempt to Stay in Power16:15 30/10/2014 Protesters, outraged by the decision of President Blaise Compaore to change the constitution in order to stay in power, have set fire to the parliament building and ruling party headquarters in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso’s capital.>>Other news of the dayPreview:Burkina Faso Protesters Set Fire to Parliament Against Leader's Attempt to Stay in Power16:15 30/10/2014 Protesters, outraged by the decision of President Blaise Compaore to change the constitution in order to stay in power, have set fire to the parliament building and ruling party headquarters in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso’s capital.>>Other news of the daySend by e-mailYour nameE-mailTo e-mailTextAll fields are required!CodeNews is sent to e-mailCloseShareDelicious DiggSeed Newsvine/politics/20141030/194856148-comment.json
