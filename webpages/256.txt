War & Conflict

 Africa: LGBTs issues in Africa

Black Looks writes about current development in LGBTs issues in Africa, “The Kenyan Times published an article in support of the South African Bill and states that it does not believe that homsexuality is “unAfrican” which in itself is quite a leap forward as that is one of the principle arguments used by African homophobes.”

Disaster
 Burkina Faso: Gorom-Gorom Food Distribution

Recently, floods unleashed havoc in northern Burkina Faso, rendering thousands of people homeless in Gorom-Gorom. A missionary blogger, Keith Smith who’s been working for over a decade among Fulanis in the arid region, quickly mobilised support for the victims. He now gives an update of the effort that was to successfully forestall humanitarian disaster and says, “our first food aid distribution was completed on Friday, and was a success, thanks to the hard work, forethought, and effectiveness of our team on the ground.”

 Africa: Is the Battle against AIDS Lost?

Forum Realisance believes (Fr) former colonial powers and pharmaceutical companies are partially to blame for the AIDS crisis but saves harsher words for Africans and failed African leaders: ” Ignorance and illiteracy reproduce AIDS blindly without the least use for reason. Isn't it sacred and legitimate to protect oneself? Why not do it? By weakness in front of the beauty of orgasm? Weakness because of the taboo of sexuality? Curious logic.”

Governance
 Burkina Faso: Ouaga 2000

Togo-based Expat French blogger Marie visited Ouaga 2000, a neighborhood in Burkina Faso's capital of which she writes (Fr): “Ouaga 2000 is a neighborhood in which you find only mansions … There, you don't feel like you are in [Burkina Faso capital] Ouagadougou. The mansions are built by ministers, people highly placed in government … It is pretty disgusting … The worst is that there is absolutely no one. The mansions are empty. Their purpose is to welcome VIP's during occasional meetings and conferences.”

 Africa: Moving on from the digital indaba

Meskel Square on “Moving on from the Digital Indaba“:
“Overall it was a huge success. One way of judging that is to look at all the discussions that are still carrying on in posts and comments and Technorati links. The discussions started with the race debate which I now wish I hadn't joined (there was just something about that pig/hairless-bulldog). But it has now moved on to thinking about what should come next.”

Caribbean
 France: The Beginnings of Affirmative Action

Says (Fr) France-based Senegalese blogger Seckasysteme about the allegedly affirmative-action induced hiring and debut of Black French newsanchor Harry Roselmack on French national television: “Roselmack's (…) professional competence and the recognition he has earned from his peers is so obvious that even the detractors of affirmative action are starting to admit the need to favor the blooming of all the hidden and underexploited talents that exist among French minorities so shamefully relegated to our ghettos.”
