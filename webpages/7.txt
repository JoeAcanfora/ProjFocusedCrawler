Burkina Faso Crisis: Violent Protests as Citizens Demand for Military Government to Vacate Office
03.11.2014  at 8:16 am By BellaNaija.com 2 Comments 
Following violent protests in Burkina Faso over President Blaise Compaore‘s attempt to extend his 27-year-rule, he resigned, and the military took over the ruling of the country.
However, a fresh crisis is emerging in the country, as citizens are demanding that the military government should step aside and the country should resume constitutional rule, CNN reports.
Violent protests occurred in the country’s capital, Ouagadougou on Sunday as the people expressed their displeasure.
The African Union (AU), Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), as well as the country’s regional leaders, are urging citizens to remain peaceful so that there can be an orderly transition to democracy.

This is wake up call for Paul Biya,Congo and DRC President.Don’t know what is the wrong with some African leaders when the people feelings changes i think it is good for leaders to take a bow instead of trying to use force to have their way.I think what President Blaise Compaore should have done is to put in Transitional government before running to Cote ‘Ivoire with his family.But he did not instead he left the country in trouble.All we have in Africa is selfish leaders who only think about their stomach and their family members and not the masses.
