U.S.-BURKINA FASO RELATIONS
The United States established diplomatic relations with Burkina Faso (then called Upper Volta) in 1960, following its independence from France. U.S. relations with Burkina Faso are excellent. In addition to regional peace and stability, U.S. interests in Burkina Faso are to promote continued democratization and greater respect for human rights and to encourage sustainable economic development. Countering terrorism and strengthening border security are of growing importance in Burkina Faso. The United States and Burkina Faso engage in a number of military training and exchange programs, including in counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance. The country is contributing to the support of U.S. efforts in the Sahel. Burkina Faso is a partner in the Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program for peacekeeping and is a member of the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership.
U.S. Assistance to Burkina Faso
U.S. assistance to Burkina Faso focuses on increasing food security for mothers and children in food deficit areas, improving the education of girls, strengthening malaria control and reproductive health services, addressing threats of meningitis and influenza, increasing production of high-potential agricultural zones, enhancing access to markets, and increasing investment in land and rural productivity.
Bilateral Economic Relations
Burkina Faso is eligible for preferential trade benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act. U.S. exports to Burkina Faso include machinery, vehicles, aircraft, and rice. The top U.S. import from Burkina Faso is gold. Investment possibilities include Burkina Faso's mining and communications sectors. The United States has signed a trade and investment framework agreement with the West African Economic and Monetary Union, of which Burkina Faso is a member.
Burkina Faso's Membership in International Organizations
Burkina Faso and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization.
