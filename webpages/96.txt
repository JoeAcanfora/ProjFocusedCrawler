The Guardian view on who should lead the transitional government in Burkina Faso


Editorial








No more presidents for life in Africa: that is the message from Ouagadougou

After 27 years as the ruler of Burkina Faso, President Blaise Compaoré had completely run out of political capital. His manipulation of the constitutional court, the electoral system and the national assembly in order to legitimise his continued rule had had the opposite effect. Much of the middle class and the young, full of expectations and aspirations, could no longer see in him, if they ever had, any kind of key to the future.
The good-looking army officer who seized power in 1987 had a measure of real popularity over the years, in spite of controversy about the fate of Thomas Sankara, his predecessor. He won five elections, of course with the usual tricks, but he won them nevertheless. But he instituted few reforms, skirted the nation’s real problems, and was mainly preoccupied with schemes to keep himself in perpetual office, while at the same time making himself useful to France and the United States, both of which have bases in the country.
As he plotted to change the rules yet again so that he could serve another term, the people decided they could not tolerate another dose of Compaoré. The army may or may not have been complicit with opposition leaders in easing him out. In any case, as so often happens with autocrats, his downfall was most of all a surprise to himself.
He withdrew the amendments that would have let him have another term, but tried to brazen it out, saying he would go on until presidential elections next year. But his authority had so totally evaporated that he was soon forced to take flight, rather as President Viktor Yanukovych did in Ukraine earlier this year. Indeed, there are some real parallels between Kiev in February and Ouagadougou today. Events in Burkina Faso could now move in two directions. Army leaders could ride on the back of the popular movement to take over indefinitely. That is a familiar pattern from the past. But people in Burkina Faso are already protesting against the “confiscation” of their revolution, and the African Union and the UN are insisting on a swift handover to civilians.
The army coup is an old idea that no longer works, because African populations are wiser than they were, and less starry-eyed about the capacities and virtues of soldiers. So the second direction, toward a new democratic start, is more likely. Violence could derail it, and there were worrying clashes on Sunday. But, short of such a disaster, that should mean that Burkina Faso will soon have a civilian transitional government, and elections will be held as planned next year. There will be difficulties. The opposition to President Compaoré has been fragmented. His supporters, some of them rich and well-entrenched, are still around.
The country is both poor and angry, a dangerous combination. But the chances are still fair for a reasonable outcome that would be good for Burkina Faso itself and could also have an exemplary effect on the numerous other African countries where leaders may be craftily musing on the possibility of manipulating term limits. The strong message from Burkina Faso is: “Don’t overstay your welcome.”
