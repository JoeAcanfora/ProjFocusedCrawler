					  Protesters set fire to Burkina Faso's parliament building					




Tens of thousands of protesters lit fires inside Burkina Faso's parliament building on Thursday as unrest continues to bubble up in the West African country. The protesters are demanding that Blaise Compaore, who has been Burkina Faso's president for 27 years, quit his job. At least three protesters were shot dead by security forces, Reuters reports, and Compaore has declared a state of emergency. 
Compaore, who originally seized power in a coup, sparked protests when he announced plans to alter the country's constitution in order to seek a fifth term. After the protests grew, communications minster Alain Edouard Traore announced that the government had dropped the plan. But the protesters demanded that Compaore step down now, in addition to not seeking another term.
The U.S. and France, meanwhile, have called for peace on all sides and an end to the violence. --Meghan DeMaria
