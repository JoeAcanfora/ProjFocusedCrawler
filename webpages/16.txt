OUAGADOUGOU: Burkina Faso’s army cleared thousands of protesters from the capital and fired warning shots at state TV headquarters Sunday as it sought to tighten its grip on power following the resignation of President Blaise Compaore  two days ago.Compaore’s 27 years in charge of the landlocked former French colony ended abruptly Friday after two days of mass protests aimed at thwarting his bid to change the constitution to extend his rule.The army then selected Lt. Col. Isaac Zida  as transitional leader, overriding an earlier claim by the army chief of staff.But there were signs of discontent with the appointment as thousands gathered in the capital Ouagadougou to demand a return to civilian rule, in line with the West African country’s constitution.Witnesses said prominent opposition leader Saran Sereme  and an army general, along with a crowd of their supporters, headed to the RTB Television  to declare themselves in charge of the transition but were thwarted by the army.Gunshots rang out at the station and the channel was taken off the air. There were no reports of anybody being injured.Shortly afterward, presidential guards moved in to prevent access to Ouagadougou’s central Place de la Nation – the site of violent demonstrations against Compaore last week.Washington has also called for a power transfer to civilian authorities and a U.N. official warned of possible sanctions if Zida did not relinquish power.Military sources close to Zida said he planned to meet with more than 40 opposition parties during the day ahead of an announcement at 6 p.m. local time.Earlier, local people voiced outrage over what they saw as an attempt by the army to hijack their uprising and criticized the role of Zida, a large bespectacled man little known outside military circles whose trademark is a red beret.“They are coming from Kossyam to enslave us,” protester Sanou Eric said, referring to the country’s presidential palace. “This is a coup d’etat. Zida has come out of nowhere.”“I am here to stop the army from stealing our victory,” said another protester, Boubacar Sow.The head of the U.N. Office  for West Africa joined the U.S. and the African Union  in rejecting the army’s seizure of power but expressed cautious optimism about a return to civilian rule.Under Burkina Faso’s constitution, the head of the National Assembly  should take office if the president resigns, with a mandate to organize elections within 90 days. However the army has dissolved the legislature and suspended the constitution.Locals blame Compaore for not doing more to tackle poverty in the nation of 17 million people by reinvesting government earnings from the gold and cotton sectors.Diplomats say one reason why Compaore was so reluctant to leave power was his fear of prosecution on human rights charges, possibly linked to the death of left-wing revolutionary and former President Thomas Sankara, dubbed “Africa’s Che Guevara.”The United Stated and other Western countries have urged leaders to respect their constitutions, although analysts say external pressure to democratize may be governed by strategic interests.Washington can freeze military cooperation with Burkina Faso  if it deems that a coup has taken place.
