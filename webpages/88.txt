26. The White House expressed concern about the “deteriorating situation” in Burkina Faso and called on all sides to end the violence.

In a statement Wednesday, National Security Council Spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said:

The United States is deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation in Burkina Faso resulting from efforts to amend the constitution to enable the incumbent head of state to seek another term after 27 years in office. We believe democratic institutions are strengthened when established rules are adhered to with consistency. We call on all parties, including the security forces, to end the violence and return to a peaceful process to create a future for Burkina Faso that will build on Burkina Faso’s hard-won democratic gains.


27. Around 1,500 people broke through security forces and ransacked parliament’s offices, burning documents, stealing equipment, and setting cars ablaze, Agence France-Presse reported.
