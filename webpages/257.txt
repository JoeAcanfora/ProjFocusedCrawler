 Africa: World Cup Report Card

Says Senegalese blogger Seckasysteme (Fr): “African football is not up to par and its presence in the World Cup is mostly symbolic. Too bad that the numerous individual African talents could not orchestrate a comeback. (…) Why couldn't such talented African football players achieve the same performance in their national teams as they did in their respective clubs?”

Missionary blogger Keith at Under the Acacias introduces a day in the life of a taxi-driver in the capital, Ougadougou, asking: “If you as a rich tourist can easily afford the extra 10p that may help buy the driver's children's dinner, should you worry if he charges you extra just because you are white?”

 Africa: What Internet Brings

Generation Consciente, Une Autre Afrique writes: (Fr)“A book by Cameroonian Jacques Bonjawo, Internet, a Chance for Africa  [L'Internet, Une Chance Pour l'Afrique in French] talks about the benefits of new information and communication technologies for Africa. However, the Internet promotes extraversion even if it is a way to make local cultures known. It glamourizes migration by forcing comparisons of standards of living, of  educational, employment opportunities and of access to networks. “
