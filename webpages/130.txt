Good week
Quarriasha Abdool Karim, who has won the World Academy of Sciences prize for her work in developing tools to protect women from HIV in South Africa.
The Association for Progressive Communications South Africa, who have won a GEM-Tech award for its investigation into the connection between the internet and violence against women.
Bad week
Blaise Compaore, president of Burkina Faso, who has resigned following violent protests at his attempt to extend his 27-year rule.
Ban Ki-moon, after a review into whether a UN peacekeeping force in Darfur had intentionally tried to cover up crimes found incidents were going unreported.
Quote of the week
Naomi Teah treated for Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia, talks about how being an Ebola survivor can be just as tough as fighting the disease.

My man can’t even talk to me. I was thinking that [he] was going to be happy, but since I came back, his ways changed towards me. He does not care how me and the children eat and I am not strong enough yet to go look for food. People say I don’t have Ebola, but still my husband won’t come near me.”

What you’re saying
In response to our article 15 steps to a more effective UN, LinkedIn user Jason Brown says the UN should stay true to its founding aims.

For me, a problem is that the UN has become too much about contracts for private contractors and a not enough about human rights, such as freedom of speech. That is the foundation of the United Nations, not to act as an outreach centre for global chambers of commerce, or their interests.”

This week in numbers
$100 million of funding from the World Bank Group to tackle Ebola.
24.7 million people are food insecure in Sahel, Central African Republic.
1,000 refugees in Australia to be resettled in Cambodia.
$61.48 the price of a full protective suit against Ebola.
1 MSF nurse protests Ebola quarantine after returning from West Africa.
