Jesse Matthew was arrested in Texas on Sept. 24, just one day after being charged with the abduction of 18-year-old University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.
Police arrested Jesse Matthew, 32, in Galveston, Texas on the afternoon of Sept. 24, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo revealed during a press conference later that evening. The arrest comes one day after Jesse was charged with abduction with the intent to defile, and 11 days after UVa student Hannah Graham disappeared following an off-campus party on Sept. 13. Sadly, Hannah is still missing at this time.

Jesse Matthew Arrested: Suspect Of Hannah Graham Case In Custody
It is unclear how Jesse got to Texas but we’re so relieved to hear that he’s been captured. The search for Hannah, however, continues.

“This case is nowhere near over,” Chief Longo told reporters today, according to NBC News. “We have a person in custody, but a long road ahead of us. We’re asking every person within the sound of my voice to find Hannah.”

Chief Longo did not reveal any details about Jesse’s arrest but according to the Galveston County Sheriff’s Office, Jesse was apprehended on a beach in Gilchrist, Texas, at approximately 3:30 p.m. EST.
Special Agent Adam Lee called Jesse’s arrest “a positive close to this chapter of this very important case.”
Jesse Matthew Charged With Hannah Graham’s Abduction
Jesse, who is also wanted on an unrelated reckless driving charge, had not been seen since he sped away from the police station on Sept. 20 after being interviewed by investigators.
Police charged Jesse with abduction with the intent to defile on Sept. 22 after recovering three bags evidence during a second search of his apartment, NBC News reported.
Jesse, a University of Virginia nursing assistant, allegedly told his mom that he and Hannah “went their separate ways” after they had drinks together at a bar on Sept. 13.
“I have been talking with his mother,” Jesse’s grandmother Christine Carr told the UK’s Daily Mail. “He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car. The girl went her way and he went his … I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. They took away his car and three bags out of his apartment.”
“LJ would never hurt anybody,” she added, referring to Jesse by his nickname. “I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life. I’m sure he had nothing to do with it.”

No doubt in my mind that he killed her.  Just wondering now if he’s a serial killer.

It cannot be tolerated if this fellow or his lawyer know anything about Hannah and are witholding evidence .  If Matthew was innocent why didn’t he just STAY in police department with his lawyer?  Fleeing to Galveston does NOT look like behavior of an innocent man.  Not at all.  What didi his mother and uncle, who accompanied him to the police station do when he fled?  Were they trying to assist him to flee?  First and foremost is that this missing child must be found.  God help her poor parents.

Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.
