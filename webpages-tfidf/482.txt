PROVO CANYON, Utah – Authorities located a man who went missing during a group outing in Provo Canyon Wednesday, and officials said the missing man has autism and may have difficulty communicating.
The 20-year-old man, Stephen Simmons, was with a group in the South Fork Park area of the canyon, and he was last seen around 10:30 a.m. Police stated around 4:40 p.m. that Simmons had been found.
The man had minor injuries and was tired, and officials said he was being treated by medical personnel.
According to information from the Utah County Sheriff’s Office, Simmons has autism and is “higher functioning” but “does not speak well and will be difficult to understand and he may drool when he speaks.”
Personnel from Utah County Sheriff’s Office Search and Rescue were looking for Simmons with the help of a helicopter.
