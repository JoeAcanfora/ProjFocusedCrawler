Police in Virginia, are continuing their search for a person of interest in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham after a "bizarre" series of events that resulted in him fleeing authorities, police chief Timothy Longo said on TODAY Monday. Longo believes Jesse Matthew, 32, is the last person who had contact with Graham. He has not been charged in her disappearance, but a warrant has been issued for his arrest on charges of reckless driving after he sped away from police on Saturday. More from Longo on the case: On Matthew coming into the police station, speaking briefly with a lawyer and leaving without answering questions: "Honestly, it's very bizarre. It's certainly nothing that I've experienced in 33 years in this business." On being a father himself and empathizing with Graham's parents: "It's virtually impossible for me [to separate being a father and a police officer],'' Longo said. "I'm an emotional guy to begin with. I'm animated to begin with. This case does not do anything but make me even more emotional. To some people this might just be an 18-year-old college student, but it's somebody's little girl, and I can relate to that."  TODAY Timothy Longo (L) and Hannah Graham (R).
