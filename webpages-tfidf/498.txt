The parents of a young college student whose murder five years ago may be linked to the recent disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham said Tuesday they hope new breaks in both cases may prevent future tragedies involving young women in the area."We are desperate to find Hannah Graham so that her family has some answers," Gil Harrington told TODAY's Matt Lauer. She and her husband, Dan, lost their 20-year-old daughter after she disappeared following a 2009 concert on the University of Virginia campus.The Harringtons also spoke to Matt about:When they first thought the cases might be connected: "It really came to light to me about two weeks ago when I saw the picture of the sketch (of Matthew) .... at that point in time I said, 'Oh my gosh, I think it’s the same person,'" Dan Harrington said. Their hope that Jesse Matthew will provide information about Graham: "I would like to appeal to him to please give the family information of where Hannah is. We need to find Hannah Graham. That is vital," Gill Harrington said. On the potential impact the missing cases will have on future crimes: "It  is sad and we’re sad that this has happened. Perhaps this is a way for us not to have future events like this occur in central Virginia," Dan Harrington said. Follow TODAY.com writer Eun Kyung Kim on Google+ or on Twitter.
