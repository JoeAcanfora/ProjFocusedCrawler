          Scientific testing is being done to determine if Hannah Graham suspect Jesse Matthew is linked to Alexis Murphy's murder.

An attorney wants “scientific testing” done to determine if prime Hannah Graham disappearance suspect Jesse Matthew was involved in the 2013 murder of Alexis Murphy, WTVR in Richmond, Virginia, reported Thursday. Randy Taylor was found guilty of the teen’s murder -- even though her body was never found -- but his lawyer thinks Matthew could have been involved.
Taylor’s attorney Mike Hallahan sent a letter to Nelson County Commonwealth’s Attorney Anthony Martin to ask investigators to check for a potential link between Matthew and the presumed dead Virginia teen, CBS 6 reported.
"This is not a fishing expedition, but rather this request is based upon the evidence presented at Randy Taylor's trial and based upon those new developments relating to Matthew in the news," Hallahan wrote to the Nelson County commonwealth's attorney, according to the station.

Martin thinks there is no evidence to suggest Matthew was involved in Murphy's disappearance since a bloody hair extension and false eyelash was found in Taylor’s camper and indicates there was a struggle.
"Even though the evidence on Randy Taylor and Randy Taylor alone in the Alexis Murphy case is clear, the Commonwealth will make sure that scientific testing is done in order to bring closure to the speculation," read a statement the prosecutor's office released to the station.

Forensic DNA evidence also may link Matthew to the 2009 killing of Morgan Harrington. “The arrest of Jesse L. Matthew Jr., 32, of Charlottesville, Virginia, provided a significant break in [the Harrington] case with a new forensic link for state police investigators to pursue," State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said in a statement, according to Fox News.
Graham has still not been found since she went missing on Sept. 13 and the reward to find her was raised to $100,000. Anyone with potential information on the University of Virginia student’s whereabouts is asked to call the police tip line at 434-295-385 or the Jefferson Area Crime Stoppers at 434-977-4000.
