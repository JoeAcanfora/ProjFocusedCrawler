WEST JORDAN, Utah – Police are searching for two armed men accused of robbing a couple walking in the street in West Jordan overnight.
Officers said the altercation started near 8400 South and 2700 West in West Jordan just before midnight.
Authorities said two armed suspects pulled up  to the victims in separate cars, got out and demanded money at gunpoint.
Police said the victims handed over a backpack and some other personal items and the accused robbers took off.
West Jordan Police Lt.  Travis said, “It is a phenomenon that is occurring more and more; people just walking down the street, especially going for, wanting to take people’s cell phones and things like that.”
Officers said the suspects are described as Hispanic men; one with a large build and bald and the other with a medium build and dreadlocks.
Police said they were searching for the cars used in the alleged robbery and soon learned about a similar event  in West Valley City.
Authorities have not confirmed if the events are related or not.
