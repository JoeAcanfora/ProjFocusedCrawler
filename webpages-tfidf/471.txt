SALT LAKE CITY – Police were searching for an inmate who escaped from the Salt Lake County Metro Jail Sunday, but officials said the man has now been recaptured. 
Officials said an inmate was working in the jail’s gardens when he jumped over a chain link fence and ran northbound around 6:20 p.m., and around 8:40 p.m. Sunday officials said the man had been taken into custody. 
Authorities identified the man as Jonathon S. Mize, who was booked into the facility on January 30 of this year for several warrants, which included retail theft, false info, identity fraud, possession of a controlled substance and possession of paraphernalia. 
A press release from the Salt Lake County Metro Jail stated Mize has been a garden worker since August 11 and was not considered to be an escape risk. Officials stated he is a minimum security prisoner and is not considered to be violent or a risk to public safety.
