Arrest warrant issued for missing mom



Police said there have been no new sightings of 27-year-old Catherine Hoggle, who was captured briefly on video in downtown Germantown early Tuesday morning.
Police have charged Hoggle with misdemeanor child neglect. Her children, 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle, were last seen on Sunday.
Police say Catherine Hoggle slipped away from her common-law husband, Troy Turner, on Monday after she was not forthcoming about the children's whereabouts.
Hoggle is diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia. Her father, Randy Hoggle, said at a news conference Thursday that his daughter had recently gone off her medication. Randy Hoggle was with his daughter and the children on Sunday.
Randy Hoggle addressed his daughter directly at one point during the news conference, pleading with her to come home with his two grandchildren.
Police said they had launched an extensive search operation using nearly 50 officers that included wooded areas and shopping centers, but they have no firm leads about the children's whereabouts.
