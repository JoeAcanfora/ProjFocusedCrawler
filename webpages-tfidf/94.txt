CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was last seen Friday, Sept. 12, and reported missing Sunday, Sept. 14.
Hannah’s parents, John and Sue Graham, issued a statement after the vigil held Thursday night.
Dear Members of the UVa Community:
Last night, we attended the candlelight vigil organized by the students at the University of Virginia. We found the vigil to be extremely moving and would like to offer our sincere thanks to the students for arranging the event and to the University for enabling our attendance.
We were comforted by the evident high esteem in which our cherished daughter is held by her many friends at the University of Virginia and beyond.
We continue to be optimistic that Hannah will soon be returned safely to us. We repeat our previous appeal to contact the Charlottesville Police Department if you have any information that could help the Department’s enquires.
Lastly, it is now Friday, a week since Hannah’s disappearance. For those students planning to unwind this weekend, please be extra vigilant when you are out and walk with a buddy.
– John and Sue Graham
The search continues for the missing teen. On Friday police executed  two search warrants in connection to the case. A press conference is expected later in the afternoon, and police are hoping these search warrants will lead to a major break in the case.
If you have information that could help investigators, call the special Hannah Graham tip line at 434-295-3851.
Searches will continue throughout the weekend, with volunteer help requested.
All surveillance videos can be seen here.
All reports filed on this case can be found here.
