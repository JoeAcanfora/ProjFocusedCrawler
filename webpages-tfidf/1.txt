Surveillance Video: Mystery Man Sought in Disappearance of UVA Student
























 by Fox News Insider // 
Sep 18 2014 // 9:07am 


As seen on Fox and Friends 









Programming Note: Don't miss "On the Record," tonight at 7p/2a ET as Greta sends her team to Virginia to get the latest information on the search for Hannah Graham.






	A new lead has emerged in the search for a missing University of Virginia student, who disappeared after leaving a party early Saturday.

	Hannah Graham, 18, reportedly sent a text message to a friend saying she had gotten lost while walking home from an off-campus party.

	Now, new surveillance video shows a man who appears to follow Graham as she walks outside a downtown Charlottesville mall. Police have identified the man, but have not released his name.

Authorities say he came forward voluntarily, and told police that he saw a black male approach Graham and put his arm around her.

	He said that he followed Graham because she appeared to be distressed, but reportedly told police that Graham seemed to know the man.

	Police are attempting to locate the second man and trying to find other videos that could show the two.

	Police are also looking at other previous videos of Graham captured by businesses' surveillance cameras. One shows Graham walking past a bar, appearing to be intoxicated, and a second video shows her running past a gas station.

	Police say those two videos don't show anyone following Graham. It's believed she walked at least a mile and a half from the party.

	There is concern that Graham's disappearance is linked to other cases of missing women in the Charlottesville area.

	In 2009, Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington disappeared while walking near the UVA campus after leaving a concert. Her body was found in a rural area three months later. The case remains unsolved.

	Harrington's family has spoken out since learning of Graham's disappearance. More on that below from WSLS-TV:

		"It's heartbreaking to know that another young woman is missing and another family is going through the anguish of the missing period," mother Gil Harrington said.

		Gil Harrington knows this pain all too well. She said hearing the news of UVA student Hannah Graham's disappearance on Monday, she can't help but think of her own daughter, Morgan. Morgan was a Virginia Tech student who went missing near UVA's campus in 2009 and was found three months later murdered.

		"Every new class of first year students at UVA don't know the previous cultural history there and the high incidents of assaults against young women there," Harrington said.

		Harrington said the circumstances surrounding the UVA softball player vanishing has startling similarities to her daughter's case.

		Charlottesville Police have searched areas between Rugby Road and Grady Avenue and also here near McGrady's Pub in Charlottesville for Hannah.

		While, police found Morgan's Pantera t-shirt from the night she was murdered in the middle of both areas.

		Now, Harrington said there's at least thirteen women in the last five years in Virginia who have gone missing or been murdered.

		"It seems like there is a cluster phenomenon of missing and murdered women in that area and I don't know if it's that attributable to a crime spree or to a situation that enables these crimes to occur, but what ever the problem is, we need to address it. There's too many are missing and too many are gone," Harrington said.
