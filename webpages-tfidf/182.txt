Jesse Matthew was arrested Wednesday in Galveston, Texas, on charges linked to the alleged abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, NBC News reported. It’s unknown why he traveled from Virginia to Texas.
Graham is still missing, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said during a press conference Wednesday evening. The reward to bring her home was raised to $100,000.
"This case is nowhere near over," Longo told reporters. "We have a person in custody, but there's a long road ahead of us, and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham."
The chief took no questions and when asked if Matthews surrendered, did not answer. Longo thanked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for their help with the case and said their joint effort helped capture Matthew.
Matthew, 32, is charged with abduction with intent to defile, NBC News reported. Graham, 18, vanished Sept. 13 after she left an off-campus party, and Matthew was the last person seen with her.
Police searched his apartment and car, but did not have probable cause to keep him for questioning. He was not seen since he fled the Charlottesville police station Saturday after authorities interviewed him. At the time, he was only a "person of interest." He was charged Tuesdasy with “abduction with intent to defile,” CNN reported.
Police received 1,500 tips to date in the case and urge anyone with information to call the police tip line at 434-295-3851, CNN reported.
