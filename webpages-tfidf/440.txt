Assistant Police Chief Russ Hamill also said Wednesday that 27-year-old Catherine Hoggle of Clarksburg, who is diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia, was captured briefly on video (see bottom of article) in downtown Germantown early Tuesday morning.
Hamill said there has been no sign of the children since they were last seen on Sunday. The children are 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle.
Detectives have obtained warrant for Catherine Hoggle's arrest charging her with misdemeanor child neglect, which could carry a sentence of up to 5 years in prison if convicted.
Hoggle's common-law husband, Troy Turner, last saw her on Monday. Police said she was not forthcoming with him about the children's whereabouts before she slipped out the back door of a Chick-fil-A restaurant and walked to the Germantown Transit Center.
She had told Turner that she dropped the children off at daycare. On Sunday, police said Hoggle had the children at her mother's house and said she had taken Jacob to a friend's house. Police said Jacob wasn't there and hasn't been seen since.
"I want it over with, I want my children here with me," Turner told ABC 7 News.
