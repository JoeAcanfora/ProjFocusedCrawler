Please, please help end this nightmare for all of us. Please help us to bring Hannah home," Graham said.The Hannah Graham tip line is still open. That number is 434-295-3851.--------------------------------Charlottesville, VA - The parents of Hannah Graham released a new video, making a statement about the ongoing search for their 18-year-old daughter.In the video, Sue Graham expressed the family's gratitude for the volunteers, law enforcement, and thousands of tip line callers that have come together to help find Hannah."We would also like to thank the many, many people that have supported our family through words, deeds, thoughts and prayers, " Graham said.She went on to say someone out there knows what happened to her daughter and she desperately hopes they will come forward.More than 3,300 calls have come in to the Hannah Graham tip line so far. You can reach that line at 434-295-3851.    The full statement from the Graham family:“My name is Sue Graham. At my side is my husband John. As you know we are Hannah's parents. I will now read a brief statement. Firstly, we would like again to express our enormous gratitude to all those who have been involved in the search for Hannah, including the police, the professional search teams, the people staffing the telephone tip line, UVa students, our friends, neighbors colleagues as well as the citizens of Charlottesville and the surrounding area. We would also like to thank the many, many kind people who have supported our family during this terrible ordeal through words, deeds, thoughts and prayers. We also owe our sincere thanks to the City of Charlottesville, the University of Virginia and the concerned citizens who have contributed a total of $100,000 to the reward which is being offered for information leading to Hannah's return. We have been overwhelmed by the generosity of you all. As you are all aware, an individual has been charged with the abduction of our beloved daughter Hannah. However, despite extensive search efforts, no trace of Hannah has been found since she disappeared in the early hours of Saturday September the 13th, now more than three weeks ago. The police have received thousands of tips, and to each one of you who made the effort to call in with information, we express our heartfelt thanks. We also thank all of you who have actively searched your properties and reported the results to the police. However, despite all your efforts, Hannah is still missing.Somebody listening to me today either knows where Hannah is, or knows someone who has that information. We appeal to you to come forward and tell us where Hannah can be found. John has already said that this is every parent's worst nightmare. That is true, but it is also a nightmare for our son, James, for Hannah's grandparents and other members of our family, as well as for all of Hannah's many friends here in Charlottesville and beyond. Please, please, please help end this nightmare for all of us. Please help us to bring Hannah home. Thank you."
