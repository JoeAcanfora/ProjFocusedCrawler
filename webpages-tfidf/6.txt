SERIAL ABDUCTOR ? The Case of Missing Hannah Graham – FIND  Jesse “LJ” Matthew and Call (434) 295-3851 Immediately

Posted on September 22, 2014 by sundance  

MAJOR Update: This is getting creepy, there are several indications that Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. might be a serial perpetrator of numerous abductions.   Hannah Graham being his latest victim.
Nine victims, all of whom have disappeared in the past four years along a path that roughly follows Route 29 from Northern Virginia south to the Roanoke area: Morgan Harrington, Alexis Murphy, Cassandra Morton, Samantha Clarke, Jamisha Gilbert, Dashad “Sage” Smith, Heather Hodges, Bethany Decker and Cara Marie Holley.


Treepers – Lets see if we can collect any and all information possible on the suspect the police are now hunting. 
He is on the run.

Hannah Graham, the Virginia student who is missing, is suspected to have been abducted or harmed by a person named “Jesse Matthew”.
Suspect: Jesse “LJ” Matthew, black male, (age 32), dreadlocks and has a prior criminal history but mug shot not released. 

Police Chief Longo alluded to the fact the police dept is frozen in political correctness.
Police Chief Tim Longo gave an unusual press conference moments ago stating that this man, Jesse Matthew, walked into a police station, talked to an attorney, left with the attorney in a vehicle, and took off at a high rate of speed evading authorities. A warrant for his arrest is now public.

 

[Daily Mail Has an article about Jesse Matthew] The ‘person of interest’ in the case of missing UVA student Hannah Graham admits that he bought her drinks but denies he drove off with her in his car, MailOnline can reveal exclusively – as one thousand volunteers reportedly searched for her Saturday.
Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar.
But Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital, told his mother that Hannah did not get into his car and that the pair ‘went their separate ways.’
‘Nearly 1,000 volunteers’ participated in a Saturday search for Graham, the Associated Press reported.
The volunteers were photographed wearing bright neon vests and carrying backpacks.
They were seen walking through fields and bushes in an attempt to find the college student.
Matthew’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told MailOnline on Saturday: ‘I have been talking with his mother.
‘He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car.
‘The girl went her way and he went his.’
Matthew has lived in Charlottesville his whole life, where he works in the operating room of the UVA Hospital, sources told MailOnline. He is a nursing assistant who transports patients to the operating room.
His grandmother, Mrs Carr, says she instantly recognized her grandson ‘LJ’ when she watched the video tape released by police investigating Hannah’s disappearance.
She told MailOnline: ‘I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. (read more)

He looks like someone that is here in Durango CO. In fact I’m pretty sure I saw them both. They were sitting at a table outside of the Durango Coffee Company and it was pouring down rain and they were arguing. But I actually met him before that I’m sure. He is  homeless and is staying in a tent behind Wal-Mart.. So if they are here then they are probably going to the soup kitchen.

I love most of the takes you sleuths have on this subject. There’s a lot of sound thinking going on out there, and I’ve decided to chime in. Since the police have now issued a warrant against Matthew for Hannah’s abduction, I have to assume they have some pretty damning evidence. And I’m thinking that it might have something to do with Matthew’s car – such as tests have indentified her DNA present there – or they have located a surveillance tape showing she entered it – or have a witness (or two) who saw her get into it. If any of those scenarios are so – then they’ve got him. He claimed that he and Hannah parted company at the mall and went their separate ways. Of course, that may not be the clincher at all. But it’s a sound consideration. The police certainly must have something firm or they wouldn’t be so confident about issuing the warrant. Also – the fact that Matthew has flown the coop (or is otherwise on the lamb) doesn’t exactly scream innocence. Forget that crap that he bolted because the poor dear is “afraid” of the police. His record indicates that being arrested isn’t a rarity for him. We will see.

He is wanted for 2 counts of reckless driving. Authorities want to question him about the disappearance of Hannah.

Poster on another site said he looked like a cab driver who she got a ride with previously. He told her he was in massage school and gave cheap massages and gave her his number. She never called but had his number still in her phone. She just did a reverse lookup snd it shows the black cat rd address he used to live at! She called it in to the tip line. Not looking good for this dude!

The only real, physical connection between this guy and one case in 2005 is a vague police sketch?  His criminal background appears to be 100% traffic related.  The case for Hannah Graham is compelling because of the video and because he ran.  The other unsolveds, not so much.  Right now, it doesn’t look like a great case, but who knows, they may be hiding a trump card.

Abduction WITH INTENT TO DEFILE. Yeah, they found something that would link Matthews to other incidents more serious than reckless driving because charging someone with intent to defile is the same sort of distinction between having a marijuana cigarette in your pocket and 10lbs of weed in your trunk. They found a ‘rape kit’ or date rape drugs in Matthews possession is the only thing I can think of that would lead to that ‘intent to defile’ charge.

What is wrong with you people? This article is a flat out accusation of guilt. Publishing the guy’s address, place of employment, and car? Let the police do their jobs and stop spreading rumors. Also.. someone needs to update the missing student map. Several of these have been solved and have no connection, yet this article makes it seem as if this man was responsible for all of them.

We have been examining all possibilities.   Two of the previous suspects of murders and attacks are in prison and could not have committed the Hannah Graham abduction.  One is out of prison and was rumored to be in Colorado, but no one has found him there.
Remember, it was police and videos that brought Mr. Matthew into our scrutiny.
Innocent until proven guilty.   We respect the law and court system more than many in our government from the top down.   And many in the business of defending and exempting people because of their race.   Such as Holder, Obama, Sharpton, Ferrakhan, Shabazz, Crump, Parks, Shahid, Chapelle-Nadal, et al..

So they have something on Matthew, but all they have on the bald white guy is that he was acting suspicious and was seen on video in Matthew’s company earlier in the evening (that’s damning enough!).  But no one has mentioned the incident just seconds before Matthew walked up to Hannah.  He is walking past the camera on the opposite side of the mall.  Two women are walking toward him.  When they pass, he and one of the women high-five each other and he then walks a few more feet and crosses over to walk behind some people a few feet back from Hannah.  The next video not more than a minute later, he is walking beside her.
Who are the women?
Last year an off-duty police officer in the area was abducted by 2 men and 2 women, driven around in his car as they hit ATMs with his cards, then they killed him and drove his car around until the police caught up with them.  Charges were dropped on 3 of them (??), and the 4th got a reduced sentence.

what I don’t understand is how he got away from pursuing police after leaving the courthouse ? I get that they did not want to endanger the public with his elusive rate of speed but in this day and time could they not “radio”  other officers in the city to cut off the chase ?

The police were not “pursuing” him. They saw him on video speeding and driving in a “reckless” manner when leaving the police department. There was no police pursuit.

Have they tracked the time between when the suspect was seen with Hannah to the next time anyone saw him, for example did his roommates or neighbors see him in or around his apartment hours later or days later, what is the missing from view timeframe, knowing this could help narrow or expand the search zone, calculating travel distances, possible gas stations, etc..
