Hannah Graham case suspect denied bond after being found on Texas beach

esse Leroy Matthew, the only known suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, was taken into custody Wednesday night, Sept. 24, 2014 in Galveston County, Texas. Matthew was found camping on a beach in Gilchrist on the Bolivar Peninsula, police said.
DALLAS — A Texas judge Thursday ordered Jesse Matthew, a suspect in the disappearance of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, held without bond pending his extradition to Virginia.
In an appearance before Galveston County Judge Mark Henry, Matthew declined to request a court-appointed attorney to fight either his extradition or a Galveston County charge of giving false information to a peace officer. Henry later told CNN affiliate KPRC that he expects Virginia authorities to collect Matthew “within a day or two.”
Authorities found Matthew on a Texas beach some 1,300 miles from where he’s wanted in the disappearance.
“We have a person in custody, but there’s a long road ahead of us, and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham,” Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Wednesday night.
Matthew, who had been sought on suspicion of abduction with the intent to defile, was arrested in Galveston County. He was found on the beach Wednesday afternoon in Gilchrist on the Bolivar Peninsula, according to the Galveston County Sheriff’s Office.
Deputies were tipped off to Matthew’s whereabouts when they got a call about a suspicious person camping on the beach. One responded and ran the license plate of that person’s vehicle. It came back as wanted, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.
Matthew did not resist arrest, KPRC said.
Earlier, Matthew’s lawyer had little to say about his client.
“I am Mr. Matthew’s attorney,” James Camblos said outside his Charlottesville office.
“I was hired on Saturday. That’s the only thing that I’m going to confirm at this point. The family and I — nobody is making any statements at this point in time. We might later on, but right now we are not,” he said.
His comments came a day after authorities obtained an arrest warrant for his client, who police believe was the last person with Graham.
Matthew willingly went to a police station over the weekend, when there was no warrant for his arrest, Longo said. He asked for a lawyer. They spoke and then left, the police chief said.
Authorities are now offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of Graham, 18, a second-year student at the University of Virginia.
They have received 1,500 tips so far in the case and are urging anyone with information to call the police tip line at 434-295-3851.
Graham was last seen on September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall. Investigators have been looking for her since, and over an increasingly large area.
“We’re asking for a broader community search with property owners,” Longo told CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360″ on Wednesday night.
Specifically, he said he wants owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back.
Authorities have previously searched Matthew’s apartment and car. Although they have declined to discuss the specifics of what might have been found, potential evidence was sent to a lab for analysis.

First off you don’t even know if she is a victim she could have simply ran off or still be on a bender drinking getting ripped because the cops say he is involved he must be right is that because he is black? or is that just because you believe what ever the cops say cause they never lie so far all I can see from what I’ve read and saw is he was seen with her at one point that does not mean jack does not make him some murderer for all we know she is off doing what ever still very much alive I find it troubling how they can arrest someone for a crime that has not been committed or the very least has not been proven to be committed
