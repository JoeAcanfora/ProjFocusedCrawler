Hannah Graham: Police On The Hunt For Jesse Matthew, See Wanted Poster

Jesse still hasn’t turned himself in, and it’s been almost 48 hours since police issued a warrant for his arrest. Now they want your help to find Jesse and HollywoodLife.com has the wanted poster which indicates he was last seen driving his sister’s light blue Nissan Sentra, with the license plate: VAC4575.
Hannah Graham, 18, has been missing for over a week and now police want to talk to Jesse Matthew, again. Jesse was the last person seen with Hannah before she went missing, Sept. 12, after visiting a local bar with Jesse, but he claims he had nothing to do with her disappearance. But things have taken a drastic turn after police issued a warrant for his arrest, now he’s gone missing. Maybe by looking at this wanted poster, that HollywoodLife.com has obtained, you might be able to help find Hannah.

Hannah Graham: Jesse Matthew Wanted Poster Revealed
HollywoodLife.com spoke to Gary Pleasants, the Support Services Division Commander at the Charlottesville, VA police department: “Jesse Matthew has not turned himself in and we are looking for him.”
The wanted poster states that Jesse is 6’2, 270 pounds, has brown eyes, and brown dreads.
“I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the Earth,” police chief Longo said in a press conference, Sept. 21. “We want to talk to him.”

Jesse, who is a University of Virginia nursing assistant, allegedly told his mom that Hannah did not get in his car and they “went their separate ways” after having drinks.
“I have been talking with his mother,”Jesse’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told Daily Mail. “ He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car. The girl went her way and he went his … I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. They took away his car and three bags out of his apartment.”

But she also added that Jesse, who also goes by the nickname, “LJ,” is a good kid: “LJ would never hurt anybody. I know he is a good boy. I have known him all his life. I’m sure he had nothing to do with it.”
HollywoodLifers, we hope Jesse turns himself in voluntarily, but in the meantime take a look at the mugshot in our gallery above and make sure to call 434 – 295 – 3851, with any leads.

Wow!  Jesse Matthew is just a black kid.  Jesse is a  teenager that the white police want to hang.  Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton to the rescue.   Jesse is only 6 feet 2 inches tall and 260 pounds.  He’s such a small innocent SOB.  I’m upset because there’s not enough blacks on the Virgina police force.   Come on demonstrators, rob a few stores in Virgina, or burn down a few buildings and blame it on the white police force.

Perhaps Joan is trying to let HL know that they need to update the caption on their photo.
