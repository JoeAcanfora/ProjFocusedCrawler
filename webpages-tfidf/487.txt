LONGMONT, Colo. – A  couple said they were calling police about a young boy left in a hot car when they said the mother overheard and ran over them in her car.
According to KDVR, the concerned couple called 911 about the boy, but when help arrived, they were the ones who needed the ambulance.

Shannon Dominguez, 43, is now confined to a wheelchair and doctors say she may never walk the same again.
“All four windows were rolled up and it was in the direct sun,” Dominguez said. “It scares the heck out of me. It’s some innocent child might die.”
Now she’s dealing with a crushed left leg.
KDVR reported Dominguez and her boyfriend, Alan Mason, said 27-year-old Kristina Riddell ran over them with her white Honda back on June 7 just after 1: 30 p.m.
“She heard me on the phone with police,” Dominguez said, who called for help when she saw the boy alone in the car.
Dominguez said Riddell became angry, threatened to beat her up and punched Mason in the face.
She said they were standing in an empty parking space at a Dollar Tree store when Riddell allegedly got into her car, backed up and sped towards them, hitting her first and then Mason.

Mason went over the hood.
“She had her windows down, so I grabbed onto the door,” Mason said. “She drug me about 20 feet. I realized she was not going to stop, so I let go. I tumbled in the parking lot.”
He suffered internal and external bruising.
“She gets to work every day,” Dominguez said. “She gets to cook for her family. She gets to go out on the weekends with her family. I can’t do any of that.”
But the couple said they would do it again.
“If it means helping a child, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Dominguez said.
“We might do it a little different next time,” Mason said. “Probably call 911, then leave.”
Officials said Riddell has an extensive criminal record, including arrests for assault, domestic violence and multiple driving violations.
She is now facing charges including hit-and-run, assault and child abuse.
