Two Charlottesville sexual assaults reported same weekend Hannah Graham disappeared

CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — University of Virginia police said they’re investigating two possible sexual assaults that took place the same weekend that second year student Hannah Graham disappeared.
One of those possible assaults involves another female UVa. student.
University of Virginia Police Chief Michael Gibson says that a student reported she was sexually assaulted near Wertland street early last Sunday morning, Sept. 14.
Gibson said the second incident occurred early Monday morning, not far away, in the 200 block of 15th Street NW.
In that case, the chief says the female victim was a Charlottesville resident.
“Let me make something clear, and I do so respectfully, and we can have this conversation at another press conference — this conversation is about Hannah Graham,” Chief Tim Longo said at a Friday press conference.

When pressed by a reporter if the incidents were related, Longo replied, “don’t have any reason to believe that.”
“The issue, and I’ll say this, and then I would like stay on point is: the university and I will continually work towards — and I really think we’ve done a better job of it over the years — but we will always work towards communication,” Longo said.  “So we not only fulfill our obligation to the community to make sure that things are properly disseminated, and not just to a 6’oclock in the morning media group, but to also make sure that the university fulfills its legal obligation under the Clary Act.”

Graham was reported missing on Sept. 14, and was last seen and heard from by friends early Saturday morning.
A week after the night she was last seen, her parents said “we continue to be optimistic that Hannah will soon be returned safely to us. We repeat our previous appeal to contact the Charlottesville Police Department if you have any information that could help the Department’s inquiry.”
They ended by appealing to students: “For those students planning to unwind this weekend, please be extra vigilant when you are out and walk with a buddy.”
If you have information that could help investigators, call the special Hannah Graham tip line at 434-295-3851.
Searches will continue throughout the weekend, with volunteer help requested.
All surveillance videos can be seen here.
