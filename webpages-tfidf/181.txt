Jesse Matthew, the man charged with the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, is being taken back to the state after he was captured in Galveston, Texas, Wednesday, NBC News reported Thursday. The suspect, who is charged with "abduction with intent to defile," waived extradition. It is not known why or how he traveled from Virginia to Texas, and there is still no sign of Graham. 
There was a sexual assault allegation against Matthew 12 years ago, but charges were not filed, according to the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office in Lynchburg.
Matthew, 32, will be back in Virginia late Thursday evening or Friday, Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo said.
Judge Mark Henry in Galveston held the suspect without bond on a fugitive from justice count, NBC News reported. Matthew stood before the judge with a dark green jumpsuit, his hands cuffed, and reportedly seemed confused. He asked a few questions and was concerned that his clothes were taken when he was booked at Galveston County jail. "I should be able to have some kind of clothing,'' he said. Henry said the jumpsuit was sufficient and he would receive his personal items later.

Galveston authorities were tipped off about Matthew’s whereabouts after they got a call about a "suspicious person" camping on a beach, CNN reported. When his license plate number was run, it came back as wanted. He purportedly did not resist arrest. 
The search for Graham, 18, who has been missing since Sept. 13, still continues. “This case is nowhere near over,'' Longo said at a news conference Wednesday. "We have a person in custody, but there's a long road ahead of us and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham.'' Matthew was the last person seen with her after she left an off-campus party.
"We're hopeful that we will find Hannah and return her to her parents," Longo said on the “Today” show Thursday. "We're going to continue to have that hope until we find evidence of the contrary." The reward to bring her home was raised to $100,000.
Police received 1,500 tips to date in the case and urge anyone with information to call the police tip line at 434-295-3851, CNN reported.
