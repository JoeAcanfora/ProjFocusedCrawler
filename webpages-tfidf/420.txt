October 5, 2014
It has been three weeks and still no sign of Hannah Elizabeth Graham. However, police say the tips keep coming in and they are going to push on through until they bring her back home.
One hundred and ten officers were sent out for another day of searching, looking for clues that can lead them to 18-year-old Hannah Graham.
“I've said many times before we made a commitment and that's to find Hannah Graham, and we will do that,” says Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo. “We'll work tirelessly until such time as we do.”
It has been three weeks since Hannah was last seen walking along the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, and since then police have combed through nearly every inch of Albemarle County with hopes that they can reunite her with her family.
In fact, on Saturday Hannah’s parents asked anyone with information on their daughter's whereabouts to speak up.
“We appeal to you to come forward and tell us where Hannah can be found,” says Sue Graham. 
Throughout this weekend crews have put in over 2,400 hours of searching.
On Sunday morning officers from Hanover, Spotsylvania, Fairfax, Stafford and Albemarle counties were gearing up for the search, along with over 60 state police officers with the search and recovery team.
“We’re looking for the bread crumbs; we're looking for the pieces of the puzzle,” says Mike Berry of the Virginia State Police. “So you are looking for the cell phone, the shoes, anything that will point us in Hannah's direction.” 
They have been covering an eight square mile ring around Charlottesville where Hannah was last seen and continue to ask people living in Albemarle Co. to search their properties for any sign of the missing UVa. 2nd-year student.
“A lot of citizens have asked what they can do for the Graham's, what can they do for the men and women who are out there searching for Hannah and there's one thing you can do, it's the most powerful thing that you can do, and that's pray that this comes to a conclusion,” says Chief Longo.
If you have any information about Hannah’s whereabouts, please call the tip line at 434-295-3851.
