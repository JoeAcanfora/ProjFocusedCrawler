Virginia police focused their search Tuesday for a missing University of Virginia student on a text message she sent to friends saying that she'd gotten lost walking home early Sunday morning from a party.
Hannah Elizabeth Graham, 18, a second-year student, was reportedly last seen inside an off-campus apartment complex in Charlottesville, just before midnight. About an hour after she left the party, she sent the message, WTKR.com reported. She was not heard from again.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT
Graham's friends alerted police Sunday after they realized the Northern Virginia native did not return home. She was described by police as 5 feet, 11 inches tall with a trim build. She was last seen wearing a black crop top.
Charlottesville Police Lt. Ronnie Roberts told FoxNews.com Tuesday that authorities searched a large area east of the university with bloodhounds and are following up a number of tips. The search is extensive and about 50 law enforcement members were deployed Monday night.
Police released pictures of Graham in her apartment building at around 9:30 p.m. on the night she vanished. 
"Hannah is not the kind of kid that would just go on a road trip and disappear," Stephen Rice, the band director at her high school, told NBC Washington. "She was always very diligent with everything she did, and always did everything exactly by the book."
University President Teresa A. Sullivan issued a statement saying the community is "united in our deep concern" for Graham.
