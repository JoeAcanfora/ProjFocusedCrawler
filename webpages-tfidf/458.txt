The search is expanding for a University of Virginia student who went missing late Friday night. Hannah Elizabeth Graham has not been heard from since she texted her friends at 1:20 a.m. Saturday morning. Friends say she was on her way to a party, but never showed up.
Monday night Charlottesville police released two pictures of Hannah that were taken just a few hours before she disappeared. 
Several law enforcement agencies searched about 30 blocks around the UVa. Corner and near the GrandMarc apartment complex, where Hannah lives. They also used bloodhounds to search for clues. They have expanded the search to Cherry Avenue and further up Rugby Road. 
"We have a trained search and rescue team," said Guy Williams of the Albemarle County Sheriff's Office. "We're just hoping and praying that we find this young lady alive and well."
Williams led a group of about 30 deputies and volunteers Monday night as they drove through neighborhoods, talking with residents and searching for clues. After dark, they were released and asked to come back to help with the search Tuesday morning.
Anyone with information regarding Hannah is asked to contact the Charlottesville Police Department at 434-970-3280 or Crimestoppers at 434-977-4000.
