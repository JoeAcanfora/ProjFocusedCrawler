SUMMIT COUNTY, Utah – Search and rescue crews are searching for a 20-year-old man who went missing east of Rockport State Park Sunday, according to officials Monday.
Approximately 20 search and rescue members and the Department of Public Safety helicopter looked for Halden Efren who was last seen in Rockport State Park at 10 a.m. on Sunday, according to the Summit County Sheriff’s Office.
Officials believe Efren has left the Rockport area and have currently stopped the search.
Crews do not believe Efren had access to a car so they say he’s most likely on foot or possibly hitch-hiking.
Officials say Efren was involved in an  argument with a female companion while camping at Rockport.
After the confrontation, Efren left the camp and has not been seen since.
Friends told officials they believe Efren walked away to cool off but when he didn’t return, they reported him missing, officials say.
Efren is 5 feet and 5 inches tall and weighs 170 pounds. He has brown eyes and has short brown hair. He is from Micronesia and doesn’t speak English, officials say.
Efren was last seen wearing a red t-shirt, gray shorts, a baseball hat with the Chicago Bulls logo, sandals and a small backpack.
Police say Efren has only been in the United States for a month visiting family. He does not have his passport or money on him.
Although crews have stopped the search in the Rockport area, officials say it’s still an active search they’re working to determine where they’ll look next.
If anyone has seen Efren, might have picked him up in the Rockport area, call the Summit County Sheriff’s Office at (435) 615-3600.
