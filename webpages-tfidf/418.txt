The parents of a slain Virginia Tech student are pleading for information that will lead to their daughter's killer in a new video featured on the website for the television show "Unsolved Mysteries."
Morgan Harrington, 20, disappeared in October  2009 after leaving a Metallica concert at the John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville. The 20-year-old sophomore became separated from her  friends after she left the concert arena and was denied re-entry.
She  told them she would find a way home, but was never heard from again.
Witnesses saw a woman fitting Morgan's description trying to get a ride, police said. A passer-by later found her purse and cell phone between the arena and an athletic field at UVA.
In January 2010, her remains were  found in a hayfield in Albemarle County, several miles from where she was last seen.
In her parents' new video, Morgan's  father, Dan Harrington, tells viewers, "About four months after Morgan's body was found, we were told there was a DNA hit from a rape that occurred in 2005 and a sketch was produced out of that rape."
While the true-crime show "Unsolved Mysteries" is shown only in reruns on Lifetime, the show's website features new unsolved cases submitted by its viewers each week.
"Our daughter Morgan is dead, but we do not want another girl to be dead," Dan says. "We want to help save the next girl."
"We want to help save the next girl," echoes Morgan's mother, Gil.
Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the Virginia State Police tipline at 434-352-6467.
