(AP)    By T. Rees Shapiro September 15  Follow @TReesShapiro    A University of Virginia student who graduated from Fairfax County’s West Potomac High School has gone missing in Charlottesville, and university leaders have expressed “deep concern” about her. Hannah Graham, 18, has been missing since just after midnight Saturday, according to the university and Charlottesville police. Graham last made contact with friends by text message at 1:20 a.m. Saturday. Graham’s friends called police on Sunday afternoon, and police used bloodhounds to search for her Sunday evening, but that did not produce any leads, police said.   Hannah Elizabeth Graham (Charlottesville Police)  “The members of the University of Virginia community are united in our deep concern for U-Va. student Hannah Elizabeth Graham,” university president Teresa Sullivan said.  Graham is described as a white female, approximately 5-foot-11 with a slender build. Graham has blue eyes, light brown hair and freckles. Police said that she was believed to be wearing a black crop top at the time she was last seen. Police said that anyone with tips about the case can contact authorities at 434-970-3280.  T.
