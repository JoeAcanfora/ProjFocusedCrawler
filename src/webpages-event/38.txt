HARRISONBURG, Va. (WHSV)-- Charlottesville's police chief, Tim Longo, responded to Graham's parents', saying their plea has given investigators an even clearer understanding of the importance of their work.
The search for Graham is being called one of the greatest search efforts in Virginia history.
This past weekend more than one hundred people are searched, both in the sky and on foot. This is also the first search effort in the Commonwealth to use drones. 
As the search radius continues to expand around the downtown mall, Charlottesville police say over 3,500 tips have flooded their phone lines. 
The search has also been opened up to include members of the community.Thousands of students, teachers, parents, and others, are aiding in search efforts; even some driving in from other states. There have been people on foot, ATV, mounted horse teams, and K-9 units.	 
"Despite extensive search efforts, no trace of Hannah has been found since she disappeared in the early hours of Saturday, September the 13th, now more than three weeks ago," said Sue Graham, Hannah's mother.
The search efforts will continue into the coming week.
