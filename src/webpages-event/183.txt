September 2010: Virginia woman disappears
Police also are investigating Matthew’s possible ties to a missing person case. Samantha Ann Clarke was last seen September 13, 2010, in Orange, Virginia.
Orange Police Chief James Fenwick told CNN: “We are in the process of looking at it now; we would be derelict in our duties if we weren’t doing that.”
Looking at any possible ties is “something we can’t ignore,” he said.
Clarke, 19, disappeared after slipping out of her townhouse after midnight. She told her 14-year-old brother that she was going out with friends.
Earlier this month, authorities searched a lake again in Greene County, looking for Clarke’s remains.
Her mother, Barbara Tinder, thinks a convicted murderer could lead authorities to her.
“Randy Taylor come and picked her up. He called here six times,” Tinder told Charlottesville television station WCAV. “Why would you call my daughter six times if you ain’t trying to lead her on or try to talk her to come out the house, or try to do something?”
Taylor, 43, has been sentenced to two life terms in a separate case — the 2013 abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy, although the teen’s body has never been found.
Taylor was seen on surveillance video at the same gas station as Murphy, 17. He has maintained he is innocent, saying he and Alexis went back to his camper to smoke marijuana with another man.
The other man was not Jesse Matthew, the Commonwealth Attorney for Nelson County, Anthony Martin, said.

October 2009: Virginia Tech student killed
Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, also disappeared in October 2009. She went missing while attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville after becoming separated from her friends. She was last seen hitchhiking.
Harrington’s purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the next day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, police said. A necklace she wore and her camera were never recovered.
Jesse Matthew is linked to her death through DNA, law enforcement sources have told CNN. Virginia State Police only have said that there is a “new forensic link” between Harrington’s and Graham’s cases.
Harrington’s skeletal remains were found in January 2010 on a large farm about 10 miles from where she was last seen.
In July of that year, state police announced that forensic evidence linked her death to the 2005 case of a woman who said she was abducted and sexually assaulted in Fairfax, near Washington. It was later revealed it was DNA recovered in Harrington’s killing that was linked to the Fairfax attack.
The woman described the man she said attacked her and police and FBI circulated a sketch of the suspect. The FBI said the suspect is an African-American man with facial hair. In 2005, he was between the ages of 25 and 35. He was thought to be 6 feet tall.

October 2009: Lynchburg woman killed
Cassandra Morton, 23, was reported missing in October 2009 in Lynchburg. About seven weeks later, her body was found off a hiking trail at the bottom of Candlers Mountain.
Parts of her decomposed body, including her head, were found scattered, CNN affiliate WSLS reported in 2012, though officials attributed that to animals. A spokesman for the Campbell County Sheriff’s Office said Morton was found under brush as if someone tried to hide the body.
Officials believe she was killed elsewhere, the station reported.
Her body was discovered by a hiker.
Campbell County Sheriff Steve Hutcherson said Tuesday that his office never closes homicide cases. “We follow up on any leads, we have to do due diligence, and we have to leave no stone unturned,” he said, while telling CNN they will investigate to see whether there is a connection to Graham’s disappearance.
The sheriff noted that Morton was reported missing by her parents the same day as Morgan Harrington, a Virginia Tech student whose body was found in January 2010.
“There are definitely some similarities, and it warrants further looking into. We’re going to do everything we can to prove or disprove. … We’ll do more investigations and see where it leads us.”

August 2009: Two Virginia Tech students killed
In August 2009, Heidi Childs and her boyfriend of four years, David Metzler, were shot dead with a rifle in a national park about 10 miles from the Virginia Tech campus in Blacksburg.
Three years later, authorities in Montgomery County, Virginia, announced they had DNA evidence in the case. They didn’t say how the DNA was obtained.
“We have DNA, we are aggressively and actively pursuing you,” Sheriff Tommy Whitt said, according to CNN affiliate WJLA. “We will not rest until you are apprehended.”
Whitt said that Childs’ purse, cell phone, credit card, digital camera and Virginia Tech ID were stolen.
The Washington Post reported at the time of the killings that Childs’ body was outside the car, while Metzler was inside the vehicle.
Sheriff’s Capt. Robert New confirmed Tuesday to CNN’s Jean Casarez that “they are following this case (of Jesse Matthew) closely” to see whether it is connected to the killing of Childs, 18, and Metzler, 19.
The area is two hours from Charlottesville and 90 minutes from Liberty University in Lynchburg, where Matthew once attended college more than dozen years ago.

‘New forensic link’
The search of Wednesday also included U.S. 29, outside of Charlottesville, where another woman reportedly disappeared.
The search follows reports that Virginia State Police found a “new forensic link” between the Graham case and the death of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, who went missing after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in October 2009.
Harrington was last seen hitchhiking along U.S. 29, and her remains were found on a farm months later.
Almost from the start, speculation was raised about the possibility of a connection between Graham’s disappearance and Harrington’s death.
No arrests have been made in Harrington’s case, and the cause of her death is still under investigation.
It is the latest in a series of mysteries involving young people who have disappeared or been killed in the area, which includes the Route 29 corridor and its frightening reputation for vanishing young women.

Aerial drone search
The search for Graham now includes the use of an aerial drone — the first time, according to authorities, one has been used in the search for a missing person in the state.
The addition of the drone to the search effort comes more than two weeks after Graham disappeared from an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall.
The drone has a high-quality camera, and it will “look closer” at objects of interest, said John Coggin, chief engineer of the Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership and one of the members of the team operating the drone.
The drone is expected to help with the search of vast tracts of land in the area.
As the drone worked from overhead Wednesday, more than 50 law enforcement personnel participated in the search in Fairfax County.

Last person with Graham
Investigators believe Matthew, 32, was the last person with Graham, who was last seen September 13. He has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case, and he is being held in jail in isolation, according to Charlottesville police.
Authorities are offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old, a second-year student at the university.
More than 3,000 tips to Graham’s possible whereabouts have poured in, Carter Johnson, a police spokesman, said.
As part of the search effort, police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back.

(CNN) -The man charged with the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was also investigated for alleged sexual assault when he was in college over a decade ago.
A “criminal incident information” report released Wednesday by Christopher Newport University said the alleged incident involving Jesse Matthew took place on September 7, 2003.
Matthew quit the school’s football team five days later and left the school in mid-October.
The university said federal student record privacy laws limited the amount of information it could provide publicly.
“The University is fully cooperating with law enforcement agencies,” a statement said. “The success of the criminal investigation is paramount at this time.”

UPDATE from Reporter Mike Mather: 
The search for Hannah Graham today will expand to southern Albemarle County and neighboring Nelson County. So far, the search has covered more than 200 square miles in Albemarle County.
Today, 50 law officers are back scouring the countryside. Search directors say they expect even more forces to arrive by this afternoon.
The search for Hannah Graham has continued on the ground and in the air with both the drones and helicopters. And aircraft with a special high resolution camera will also be put into service, taking pictures of the area, looking for things like tire tracks and anything out of the ordinary.
But the Albemarle County police chief admits the search area is massive and there are so many places that could be easily overlooked. Meanwhile, suspect Jesse Matthew was scheduled for a court hearing this morning on a reckless driving charge. But that case was postponed until December along with the charges that he had abducted Hannah.
So as a search for Hannah continues, the one thing the chief says he needs, is someone who knows what happened to come forward.

From WTKR reporter Nadeen Yanes: 
I just spoke with Tim Baggett, a former running back at CNU who was on the same team as Jessie Matthew in 2003. He says he doesn’t really remember Matthew from football. But does remember one distinct interaction that stands out today– 11 years later.
In 2003, Matthew helped Tim shake a vending machine at the student center to get chips out. Tim said thanks but says Matthew awkwardly hung around, like he wanted to be friends. Tim said Matthew was like a kid in a mans body. Described him as “socially underdeveloped” and says he acted like a young child who wanted to befriend him quickly.
He says in his personal opinion he could see where Matthew could misinterpret a smile or a thank you as someone wanting to be his friend.
But even with that, Tim is still shocked that Matthew is now linked to Hannah Graham’s abduction and Morgan Harrington’s murder among other things.
He says in his mind he could never picture a “kid” committing such horrific crimes.

From Mike Mather: Police officers are searching the land while detectives are searching old case files. It is becoming increasingly clear that Jesse Matthew has hopscotched across Virginia campuses, leaving a trail of sex-crimes investigations.
At Liberty University in 2002 he was accused of rape. But Matthew, a football player, was never prosecuted.
A year later at Christopher Newport University was a similar story. He was accused of sexual assault as a football player, but not prosecuted.
And then to Charlottesville where he’s now charged with kidnapping UVA student Hannah Graham.
That investigation then tied him to an earlier case, the 2009 murder of Morgan Harrington. She was snatched from the campus.
Now as police search for Hannah, they are also asking how many others?

The Nelson County Commonwealth’s Attorney released a statement on Thursday afternoon saying there is “no credible evidence” linking Jesse Matthew to the Alexis Murphy case. 
This comes just hours after the attorney representing Randy Taylor, the man convicted for Alexis Murphy’s murder, requested that the Commonwealth revisit the case to investigate the possibility of a connection between Murphy and Matthew. 
The statement from the Nelson County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office reads: 
The Nelson County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office, the Nelson
County Sheriff’s Office, FBI and Virginia State Police again maintain that
there is no credible evidence linking Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr. for the
abduction and murder of Alexis Murphy in which Randy Taylor was convicted.
Randy
Taylor was the last known person to have had contact with Alexis Murphy on August
3, 2013 shortly before she went missing.
All of the physical evidence at trial showing a violent struggle was
located inside Randy Taylor’s camper.
This physical evidence consisted of a diamond stud, a fingernail
fragment, a long black hair that showed signs of being forcibly removed, all of
which had Alexis Murphy’s DNA and were found on the floor of Randy Taylor’s
camper and the hair was found on Randy Taylor’s pillow.
Alexis
Murphy’s shattered cellphone was found in the brush outside Randy Taylor’s
camper.  The blue T-shirt that Randy
Taylor was seen wearing at the Liberty gas station on August 3rd when
he was seen talking with Alexis Murphy, was found under Randy Taylor’s sofa
inside his camper.  That shirt contained
Alexis Murphy’s blood and had hair extensions and false eyelashes that had
Alexis Murphy’s DNA and Randy Taylor’s DNA balled up inside the shirt.
Randy
Taylor was then seen at Applebee’s Restaurant around 10:00 p.m. August 4th
approximately 15 minutes after Alexis Murphy’s vehicle was seen pulling in the
Carmike parking lot within walking distance of Applebee’s. Taylor then got a
cab ride back to Nelson County, and refused to give authorities the name of the
person who drove him down to Charlottesville that evening.  The cab driver’s name was John Sapp who
testified at trial.
Randy
Taylor denied ever going to Liberty gas station on August 3rd and
denied ever seeing Alexis Murphy.  Only
after authorities found forensic evidence, putting Alexis Murphy inside his
camper, did Randy Taylor admit that Alexis Murphy was in his camper but was
with a third person.  According to Randy
Taylor, the “black guy with cornrows” and Alexis Murphy left in separate vehicles
and everything was fine. 
Within
days after Randy Taylor’s arrest for abduction of Alexis Murphy, Randy Taylor
and Mr. Hallahan, his attorney, were 100% certain that the black male that
Alexis Murphy left with was Dameon Bradley, a thin light-skinned black male,
who drove a maroon Chevy caprice.  Mr. Hallahan
provided law enforcement with a photo of Dameon Bradley who looks absolutely
nothing like Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr.
Dameon Bradley testified at Taylor’s trial that he did know Alexis
Murphy and they were only friends and he worked at the McDonalds at the Liberty
gas station which is a place that Randy Taylor frequented on a daily basis.
At no
time did the name Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr. ever come up by Randy Taylor or Mr.
Hallahan until Mathew’s arrest in Hannah Graham several days ago. 
Nelson
County authorities have not received any information from investigators in the
Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr. case that links him in any way to the abduction and
murder of Alexis Murphy.  Some of the
same investigators who worked the Alexis Murphy case are working with
authorities in the Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington cases.
However,
in order to dispel any further speculation, I will be meeting in the coming
days with investigators in the Murphy case to address the concerns outlined in
Mr. Hallahan’s recent letter. 
Even though the evidence on Randy Taylor and Randy Taylor
alone in the Alexis Murphy case is clear, the Commonwealth will make sure that
scientific testing is done in order to bring closure to the speculation.

Hannah Graham search highlights Virginia drone battle

It was a small interaction 11 years ago that left a big impression on former CNU football player Timothy Baggett. 
He was on the same team as Jesse Matthew — the main suspect in Hannah Graham’s disappearance. 
Now police believe Matthew could be connected to the disappearance of other women, and his former teammate is shocked. 
“The one encounter I remember with him off the field was in the student center there… I just remember him having the personality of a much younger kid. His social skills would seem to be like a middle schooler honestly. A friend of mine, I asked him about it, and he referred to him as the guy we all thought was a three-year-old kid,” Baggett says.  “I guess there is an initial moment of shock. I assume every body would have that regardless of the relation. And I immediately went back to that one memory of him and that kind of child mindset.”
