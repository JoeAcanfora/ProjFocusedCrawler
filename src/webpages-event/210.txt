 HANNAH GRAHAM: Latest information on missing college student						








 







Tempo Bar owner: We did not serve Hannah Graham alcohol

CHARLOTTEVILLE,  Va. — The owner of the bar where missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham was last spotted before vanishing without a trace has released a statement.
Brice Cunningham, the owner of Tempo Restaurant, said in a statement Thursday that Graham was never served alcohol and not actually seen inside the restaurant.
“She was, however, noticed by the door-person outside the restaurant at that time, and seen leaving with [Jesse] Matthew shortly thereafter. These details helped police reconstruct Ms. Graham’s movements and last known whereabouts,” Cunningham said.
Additionally, Cunningham said the business has been fully cooperating with police. In fact, the bar turned over credit card information that Cunningham said was able to pinpoint Matthew’s location.
“Details of credit card receipts showed that he had made purchases at the bar shortly after midnight while Hannah was still making her way towards the downtown mall from Preston Avenue. Those records also confirm that he returned to Tempo at 1:10 am and left shortly after…”
Police said last week that witnesses told investigators they saw Graham and Matthew enter Tempo and that Matthew bought alcohol.
Hannah Graham suspect found camping on Texas beach
Matthew, 32, was arrested after he was discovered camping on the beach in Gilchrist, Texas on the Bolivar Peninsula Wednesday afternoon. When they ran his license plate number around 3:30 p.m., they found out he was wanted in Virginia. He was charged with giving false information to a police officer.
“For his Galveston County charge, I assume we’re probably going to have to defer to Virginia,” Galveston County Judge Mark Henry  said. “I suspect they’ll be down here to extradite him in a day or two. “

A federal law enforcement source confirmed a phone call made from a borrowed cell phone in Louisiana, to Virginia, is how police first discovered Jesse Matthew was out of the state and on the run.
For over 10 days police have been aggressively coordinating search efforts and collecting information surrounding the  disappearance  of the second-year University of Virginia student.
Witness accounts and surveillance video led police to obtain a search warrant for Matthew’s car, and then his home. Then two days later police returned to his home in Hessian Hills, searching for clothes and took more evidence.
As some evidence came back from forensics testing, police issued an arrest warrant for Matthew, for abduction with intent to defile.



Hannah’s disappearance still boggles community
New missing person poster released reflects increased reward.
On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away from the party. That was shortly before midnight.
About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught Graham outside of a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday.
Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station — no one appears to be pursuing her — and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station.
The surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the pedestrian outdoor mall in downtown Charlottesville, about 1:06 a.m. The camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, with Matthew walking beside her, police said.
At 1:20 a.m. she texted her friends to say she was lost and trying to find a party. She was seen with a man said to be Matthew, who had drinks at Tempo between 1:30 and 2 a.m..
Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, Longo said, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself.

What’s next? 
Hannah Graham’s location is still unknown, and she’s been missing twelve days.
Police have interviewed 60 people and received more than 100 tips in the case, police said. Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers and Virginia Department of Emergency Management officials spent the weekend searching for clues that would lead them to Graham.
As time passes, the search area grows, investigators say. As word spread that Matthew had been arrested, neighbors said they hoped police could now just focus on finding Hannah, and hopefully safe.



The city of Charlottesville, the University of Virginia and the local community have contributed $100,000 to a reward for “information leading to the cause” of Graham’s disappearance. Anyone with info is asked to call the tipline

Police are encouraging residents to check their properties. And still, police hope anyone with information will come forward.
Anyone who saw Matthew’s burnt-orange 1998 Chrysler coupe on Saturday, Sept. 13,  should call the police tip line  at 434-295-3851.

Ah, yes.  Victim-blaming.  Because I’m sure that you’ve never been intoxicated, and not had all your wits about you.
If you had been, it surely would have been OK for someone to victimize you, right?

hmmm, a very conflicting turn of events. Bar owner says she was never there and never served alcohol while eye witnesses say she was there with Matthew and that they saw him buy her drinks. Interesting. Prosecutors have work to do.

I can’t understand why she keep roaming around after she text saying she was lost. Why didn’t they tell her to wait for them or tell her which way to go.

WHO

Of course the Bar owner says they never saw or served her……..especially now that they know she is 18 YEARS OLD.  Last time I checked, the legal drinking age in Virginia was 21.  “Ain’t nothing wrong…….but something ain’t right.”

Yeah something doesn’t add up. They were seen together before he bought drinks in the bar. So, what, he was like hey Hannah wait outside here for awhile while I go in and get some drinks. And she just stood around by the door waiting for a total stranger? That doesn’t make sense. The owner didn’t even know Jesse was there twice until he looked through the bar receipts so how can he say for sure that Hannah wasn’t in there?

That’s exactly correct. And you also have to consider the TEMPO only has a license to serve alcohol until 1AM, as their sign in the video states: Mon-Sat  4:30 PM -1AM. So if  more people won’t talk to police, we may never know about those CRITICAL CLUES IN THE TIMELINE
 that will reveal who was with Hannah Graham AFTER 1AM that mysterious morning.

Does anyone know whether Hannah’s cell phone log shows whether she contacted Jesse prior to their meeting in the vicinity of the Tempo?  I haven’t heard police mention any details of her cell phone logs, whether texts or phone calls.  Or did Jesse’s phone log show any prior contact with Hannah?  Or did he make a call from someone else’s phone to Hannah?  Bar receipts show that Jesse bought a drink at the bar shortly after midnight.  Hannah was walking/running hurriedly towards the downtown area during that time, and apparently didn’t arrive until around 1 a.m.  Was she late for an appointment to meet someone?  Just wondering.

He could have slipped her something, then went in the bar and waited for the drug to take effect.
