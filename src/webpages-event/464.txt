Authorities say there are â€œdefinite suspicious circumstancesâ€ surrounding the disappearance of a pregnant Twentynine Palms woman who was last seen leaving home to go to Joshua Tree National Park on Saturday.
San Bernardino County sheriffâ€™s detectives are asking for the publicâ€™s help locating 19-year-old Erin Corwin, who is white, 5-foot-2 and about 120 pounds, with brown hair and blue eyes. She was driving a blue 2013 Toyota Corolla with California license plate 7CJX519. She has no history of medical or psychological issues, the Sheriffâ€™s Department said in a news advisory issued Tuesday, July 1.UPDATE: Car found, but woman still missing

Anyone with information about Corwinâ€™s whereabouts was asked to immediately contact investigators at 909-387-3589. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous may also call the We-Tip Hotline at 1-800-78-CRIME (782-7463) or leave information at www.wetip.com.
Corwin left her home for the park at 7 a.m. Saturday, and her husband reported her missing the next day, the Sheriffâ€™s Department said in a news advisory. Deputies, search-and-rescue teams and other volunteersÂ searched the area on the ground and by air, but were not able to find her.
The sheriffâ€™s Specialized Investigations Division-Homicide Detail is now assisting in the investigation.
â€œThe specialized division was asked to assume the investigation because they felt that there were definite suspicious circumstances,â€ sheriffâ€™s spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said. The division has advanced investigative skills, including interviewing techniques, and is well-suited â€œwhen it comes to investigations that involve the possibility of foul play.â€

Corwin announced on her Facebook page Jan. 16 that she was pregnant. Both she and husband Jonathan Wayne Corwin, a corporal in the U.S. Marine Corps, list themselves as being from Oak Ridge, Tennessee. According to their Facebook page, they have been married for a year and a half.
Bachman said she believed Erin Corwinâ€™s mother is in town on a visit that had been planned before Corwin went missing.
Investigators are not seeking volunteer help for search-and-rescue efforts at this time, Bachman said.
â€œThey really donâ€™t know where she is or what happened to her, and there is the potential for foul play,â€ so any search parties could potentially contaminate evidence, she said.
