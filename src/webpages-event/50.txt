‘Hannah Graham. Where are you?’ gatherers asked at a vigil for the missing 18-year-old University of Virginia student on Sept. 18. See the heartbreaking photos.
Students, family members and loved ones gathered on Sept. 18 for a vigil in honor of Hannah Graham, the 18-year-old student who disappeared on Sept. 13. While holding candles and playing music in the University of Virginia Amphitheater, all who attended had one wish: Hannah’s safe return home.

Hannah’s classmates brought along reminders of the second year student’s hobbies like skis and an alto saxophone, which she plays. Organizers also passed out her favorite candies, including Starburst, according to Daily Mail.

Friends also wrote a letter to Hannah, which was read at the memorial. It said, “It’s hard to fathom the confusion, fright, anger and sadness we’ve felt since you went missing. You make things good, Hannah Graham. Where are you?”
“We all just want to come be here for Hannah,” Eliza Costas, one of the 5,000 attendees, told NBC News. “We are keeping her family in our prayers and hope for the best.”

“Those who do know her and those who don’t, it really doesn’t matter. It’s mostly, she’s a member of the UVA community. A lot of people know her, who she is as a person, what organizations she was involved in, and we’re really just trying to all come here together and hope for her safe return,” Eric Dotterer told NBC 29.
A number of people spoke at the vigil, including Hannah’s close friends and the student class president. Everyone who attended had one hope and belief, that their classmate and friend will be found.

Police recently released new surveillance videos from night Hannah disappeared. Based on these videos, she was last seen in the early hours of Sept. 13, walking throughout sections of Charlottesville, Virginia. Hannah was briefly followed by an unidentified man, but that gentleman, who has since been identified, claims that the University of Virginia student walked away with another unidentified man, who is now being sought by police.
Our thoughts go out to Hannah’s family and friends during this difficult time. We are hoping for Hannah’s safe return.
