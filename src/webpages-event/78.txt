SERIAL ABDUCTOR ? The Case of Missing Hannah Graham – FIND  Jesse “LJ” Matthew and Call (434) 295-3851 Immediately

Posted on September 22, 2014 by sundance  

MAJOR Update: This is getting creepy, there are several indications that Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. might be a serial perpetrator of numerous abductions.   Hannah Graham being his latest victim.
Nine victims, all of whom have disappeared in the past four years along a path that roughly follows Route 29 from Northern Virginia south to the Roanoke area: Morgan Harrington, Alexis Murphy, Cassandra Morton, Samantha Clarke, Jamisha Gilbert, Dashad “Sage” Smith, Heather Hodges, Bethany Decker and Cara Marie Holley.


Treepers – Lets see if we can collect any and all information possible on the suspect the police are now hunting. 
He is on the run.

Hannah Graham, the Virginia student who is missing, is suspected to have been abducted or harmed by a person named “Jesse Matthew”.
Suspect: Jesse “LJ” Matthew, black male, (age 32), dreadlocks and has a prior criminal history but mug shot not released. 

Police Chief Longo alluded to the fact the police dept is frozen in political correctness.
Police Chief Tim Longo gave an unusual press conference moments ago stating that this man, Jesse Matthew, walked into a police station, talked to an attorney, left with the attorney in a vehicle, and took off at a high rate of speed evading authorities. A warrant for his arrest is now public.

 

[Daily Mail Has an article about Jesse Matthew] The ‘person of interest’ in the case of missing UVA student Hannah Graham admits that he bought her drinks but denies he drove off with her in his car, MailOnline can reveal exclusively – as one thousand volunteers reportedly searched for her Saturday.
Jesse ‘LJ’ Matthew has confirmed he met the 18-year-old in Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall on the night she went missing and bought her drinks at a local bar.
But Matthew, a nursing assistant at UVA Hospital, told his mother that Hannah did not get into his car and that the pair ‘went their separate ways.’
‘Nearly 1,000 volunteers’ participated in a Saturday search for Graham, the Associated Press reported.
The volunteers were photographed wearing bright neon vests and carrying backpacks.
They were seen walking through fields and bushes in an attempt to find the college student.
Matthew’s grandmother, Christine Carr, told MailOnline on Saturday: ‘I have been talking with his mother.
‘He said he went his way and she went hers. He told his mother he bought her some drinks. He said she did not get into his car.
‘The girl went her way and he went his.’
Matthew has lived in Charlottesville his whole life, where he works in the operating room of the UVA Hospital, sources told MailOnline. He is a nursing assistant who transports patients to the operating room.
His grandmother, Mrs Carr, says she instantly recognized her grandson ‘LJ’ when she watched the video tape released by police investigating Hannah’s disappearance.
She told MailOnline: ‘I saw the video tape. That is him, that is LJ. The police went through his car and his apartment. (read more)

I am posting this again, because two women were assaulted the days after Hannah went missing.  Is it possible whoever is responsible for Hannah disappearing is addicted to this and craved more and continued on the next two nights attempting similar acts with these two women (one is a student, other is a resident)?
This is from the UVA police:
September 18, 2014
To the University community:
I write to inform of two incidents under investigation by the Charlottesville Police Department that have recently come to our attention.
The first incident involves a female U.Va. student who reported being sexually assaulted near Wertland Street in the early morning hours of Sept. 14.
The second incident is believed to have occurred in the 200 block of 15th Street NW during the early morning hours of Sept. 15, where police discovered an unconscious female who is a local resident. The circumstances regarding her injuries are unclear and are being investigated as a possible sexual assault.
Creepy thought the same person could be responsible, and coincidentally Hannah was at Wertland and texted her friend (or someone did from her phone) that she was lost in that area in the early hours of Sept 13.

If I were going to speculate, I would wonder if there’s some connection between the victims being at the hospital, perhaps to visit a friend or loved one who was there, and that’s how he managed to ‘bump into’ his victims.
Or maybe I just watch too much Criminal Minds…

He obviously is that smart. He was the last person seen with her. He walked into a police station asked  for a lawyer then disappears before he can be questioned,  right under the nose of authorities. If he is responsible for all of the disappearances he’s even smarter because he got away with them for this long.  If it weren’t for one small slip up of being seen on video putting his arm around this girl,  we would never know he met her at all. The only charge they have on him is reckless driving. Don’t be so nieve,  this guy is very smart.

Darrell Rice was convicted of one of the 1996 I-29 attacks.  In 2006, he was released from jail to a halfway house, and completely released in 2007, then went back into prison several times for violations.
Rice is out of prison again and his whereabouts are not known to the public.  He was rumored to be in Durango, CO, but they can’t find him there: http://durangoherald.com/article/20140613/NEWS01/140619762/Police-ask-for-calm-over-rumors-about-ex-prisoner
1996 article about 1-29 attacks and disappearance of Alicia Reynolds: http://www.readthehook.com/85777/cover-cold-case-alicia-showalter-reynolds-fall-and-rise-darrell-rice
Chilling quote: “In an interview with Stan Gregg on March 4, 2003, U.S. Marshal Larry Carter (now deceased) claimed that Rice admitted to a “rage against women” that sometimes erupted when he was on the highway and that he liked to “run women off the road” on Route 29. When Carter asked what he did after that, Rice said he would “just keep going.””

Didn’t the chief indicate that the police department was ‘frozen by political correctness’?
Clearly both sides – the police and the suspect – know that he is wanted for his connection to the abduction.  Yet their inability to put it on the wanted poster speaks volumes if we but listen.
Given all we’ve heard and read about the Zero/Holder justice system, namely the DOJ’s ‘disparate impact’ regulations, maybe the police are not allowed to declare him a suspect in the abduction/disappearance.  He may just be a beneficiary of that paralyzing malaise that Holder has cast over a lot of urban law enforcement departments in predominantly black crime areas, with his demands for equal numbers of racially segregated arrests, indictments,  trials and convictions, and ahem, ‘leniency’, or rather ‘sweeping under the rug’,  for anything and anyone coming in over the quota.

He has relatives named Benjamin Carr and Christopher Carr.  Sister is Nicky Matthew.  Father is Jesse Leroy Matthew (he has an extensive criminal history).
A couple of his close friends are:  Benjamin Lloyd Cottrell and Derek Denardo Ragland.  I will do more digging tomorrow but those are a few names to look into.
By the way – the friends have extensive criminal records, too, with Derek’s being worse than Ben’s.  It’s possible that one of them knows where he is or is even hiding them.  Derek has been in trouble before for “obstruction of justice”.

There are some good cops and there are some great ones, and some of them suck big time.  Some can be real pricks when they want to, which in some cases is all the time.
I suggest reserving hero worship for a less diverse group.  Meanwhile, hope for the best from them but be ready for the worst.  Learn and remember your rights under the law, and avoid automatic trust in them.
We, the people, are the backbone of our nation, not any government worker, which is what cops are.

There is an Amtrak station in Charlottesville. Its where the Amtrak train from Chicago dumps you off to take a bus to Richmond, Va. Its not a very nice neighborhood though UVA Medical Center is only a few blocks away but there was nowhere near to get a bite to eat and the Amtrak train from Chicago ( the 51 Cardinal) doesn’t have a dining car. I remembered that the last time I caught that horrible train back ( the heat in my roomette wasn’t working and it was January so I had to ride in coach or freeze) but I bought a bunch of food at the food court at the Chicago Station which I shared with a young woman returning to UVA from a Xmas trip home. I felt bad leaving her to walk back to campus alone as it was getting towards dusk but my bus was leaving in a few minutes ( the train was late) so I bade her farewell and got on my bus for the hour or so ride back to Richmond. I thought about that seedy Amtrak station and how many UVA coeds must have to make that half a mile or so walk back to the UVA campus dragging a suitcase behind them.

I haven’t checked the Amtrak site but there are two stations in Richmond. The Staples Mill station and the downtown station. Staples Mill if fine if nothing grand. Just a waiting room with no restaurant ( there are some restaurants on Broad St if you have the time and inclination to walk that far as the parking lot and access road leave you a 1/4 mile or so from that main drag.) The downtown station is a very grand old railroad station but not used much. Its in the a more dangerous area after nightfall as its by the nightclub and bar district.

I know there is attorney/client privilege, but, many times in these cases the attorney will state whether or not they have been in contact w/their client or say they have told them to turn themselves in.

The chief did not say that JM fled with the attorney with him.  The chief said “he fled” and that then a warrant was issued for two counts of reckless driving because there was someone else in the car.  He also first said JM arrived at the PD with relatives.
It seems more likely that JM fled with a relative than an attorney who just met him and who knew JM was in trouble.  If you were that attorney, would you willingly get into a vehicle with a man wanted for questioning in a possible abduction-murder, possibly making yourself a hostage?
It’s probable the attorney told JM he didn’t have to talk to the cops at all, he’d be better off keeping his mouth shut and hitting the road, which would be the best advice a defense attorney could give under those circumstances, much as we don’t like that in a case such as this.

Kitty ~ thanks for the clarification, I’ve read a relative & also the lawyer, BUT, it’s what the chief stated that is relevant.  I agree, it’s not likely an attorney would “flee” with Jesse for any reason.
Your suggestion as to what the attorney possibly told Jesse is plausible & probably what may have happened, “you don’t have to talk to LE.”   Jesse fleeing makes him look guilty, it he is innocent, he would be smart to show up w/his own attorney, LE would have to charge him or release him if they didn’t have the evidence to hold him.     imo, it’s only a matter of time before he’s apprehended on the driving charges & it remains to be seen if that’s the least of it..

I have found the surveillance video on utube of Alexis Murphy, from the gas station, of where she was last seen. In the video, you can she her walking by a burnt orange car, the same color as the one police impounded from Matthew. It looks to be the same type of car as well. Now, what  are the odds that the same color car, burnt orange at that, would be in the same area that 2 young girls went missing. Due to the angle of the video, it’s hard to tell which way the car is parked. An employee from the gas station, testified at Randy Taylor’s trial, that he liked to pull in backwards in a parking space, to watch young girls. A couple of other things worth noting: Randy Taylor stated that a black male, with cornrolls was involved. Cornrolls, dreads, something. Alexis’s car was found in Charlottesville, and RT stated that he took a cab back home. Matthew used to be a cab driver. Is all this pure coincidence?

| In August, Taylor’s attorney argued in court that investigators arrested the wrong man.
His lawyer showed a picture of a black man with cornrows, saying, “this individual has seen Alexis since [Taylor] has seen Alexis.”
The lawyer refused to give the man’s name. |

I’d say almost too much.
Although in Morgan’s case, having found the body/DNA evidence- could hopefully sink the bastard. Conceivable they already, or about to, have a match. they’ve been in his apt now twice. Left with 2 evidence bags Yesterday.
As for randy Taylor, he has stuck to claims he didn’t kill her, but he knows where the body is. There were 3 persons of interest. One guy out of state, the police confirmed existed & interviewed. And I guess cornrows is #3?? But w/o a body for evidence, & RT so uncooperative, perhaps they dropped it? Idk.
But RT wanted 20y in exchange for body location. Family of Alexis opted for life sentence instead. Unforseen & Unfortunate in outcome, if JM was cornrows- left free to prey on the other girls.
Also 2005 sexual assault case linked to Morgan 2009, (sketch) textbook in progression of the violence perpetrated in his crimes. But a scary, long space of time there in the middle.
***Do we know JM’s employment prior to UVA? Think I read only there since early August.

ummm…i’m pretty sure that ‘out of state guy” and “cornrows” is the same person. It was stated that the “cornrows guy” left the state to go on vacation. He left the next day, after Alexis went missing. JM drove a car prior to UVA. He worked in the operating room at UVA, as a nursing assistant. He was also responsible for transporting patients to and from the operating room. Which another thing I don’t understand. He would have had to obtained and held a license. With some of his priors, how was he able to that. This whole thing could open up a whole new can of worms.

We were told she was under some influence of alcohol already upon leaving the party.  If it was in fact she who sent her friend the ‘I am lost’ text, she might have been getting worried and loosing good judgement all at once.  If he approached her and offered to walk her towards her dorm, maybe claiming he’s going to the same place anyway, she would probably allow herself to take a chance.  He then could have asked for a moment’s delay to finish up his drink, while guilting her into having one.  Maybe he even drugged her then?
Speculation is not always pleasant, but it can be very helpful.  According to her family and the chief, she was a resolute young lady, not a tramp; and he might be very charming, skilled in appearing non-threatening due to his job, and/or an evil genius for all we know.  I’d love to hear what the bartender had to say about this encounter.   At that time of night and with so little street traffic, plus given their obvious physical appearance dichotomy, they must have been memorable.

Also another connection to Harrington:
“Police have yet to track down her killer, and her family has long said they suspect there could be other victims. ***The T-shirt Harrington was wearing when she disappeared was found near where Graham disappeared.”

Maybe the cops asked JM for a buccal swab while he was at the PD and the attorney told him to get out fast without leaving so much as a fingerprint or a hair behind.  They should be able to get his DNA from the car, but a buccal swab is better – direct and definitive.

I’m curious whether the police department where Matthew showed up has surveillance cameras in the lobby/front desk.  It would be good to see some pictures of the ‘lawyer’ who came to consult with him.  CNN’s Jean Casares says she asked the Pro Bono/Public Defender’s Office whether they dispatched someone to assist him, and they denied being involved (apparently under the law there a person has to be arrested/charged to qualify for a PDO lawyer, and he was neither).
Is it possible that he had a lawyer on retainer, as on standby, due to his numerous run-ins with the law?   Or has he hired one that morning, before engaging with the police? But then, why did the lawyer not just come in with him, but needed a full hour to get there? This part of the case makes no sense at all.  Maybe it was actually not a lawyer at all, but Mathew’s buddy or even accomplice?

My thoughts. Matthew has been publicly indicted,tried, convicted and ready for sentence before there has been any evidence for even an arrest warrant for Hannah’s disappearance. As a 10-year resident of Charlottesville I have the utmost confidence and respect for the police department and particularly Chief Longo. However, I feel that he is jumping to unwarranted conclusion here and has been blindsided from the real predator who was the white man following her from the beginning and claims he went on when Matthew joined her. Now, think about it. What white man is going to walk off and leave a disoriented young white girl in the hands of an older black man without lingering around and watching to see their disposition. Yes, they went into the bar and it was close to closing time. So the white guy waited. There are so many dark wholes to hide in without being seen on that mall, that’s an easy task. They exited the bar about 15 minutes later. That white guy waited followed and saw them so their separate ways. That’s when the white guy got her!  He came forth as a witness ONLY because he was seen in the cameras so that he could cast all eyes on the black guy in the video. That man has successfully gotten all eyes off of him and got Matthew targeted. Why was the white guy standing/hiding himself in the doorway of a store. He was waiting for her there. I would not be surprised if he hadn’t spotted her when she first approached the mall. Now get this, if Matthew was looking for somebody to attack he would not have been walking down the middle of the mall in everybody’s sight and make a U in everybody’s sight and openly slip his arms around her waist in everybody’s sight – nor would he have gone into the bar with her under cameras if he is the abductor. Right now, Matthew is scared because he was with her, he doesn’t deny that. Not only that, I’m black and all of you blacks out there – would anyone you know who would be guilty of this crime go home and park their car at home in the open and then voluntarily go to the police department and request an attorney – I don’t think so – let’s be real about black folks! I don’t care how slow he may be – no way would he go home – nor would his friends or family members be there with him – there would need to be some type of evidence of dirt, struggle, something if Matthew had done this. He was drunk himself.  If he was my son, friend, or acquaintance, I would want him to stay away until we were sure to get him top flight legal representation!!!  I do not believe that he is responsible for Hannah’s disappearance. I pray to God that she is found and the truth is found. I pray for family members on both sides.  My thoughts.

I truly do not believe that it ends with JM. There is whole lot more to this story. I agree 100% that there is something about the white man, that just doesn’t sit well. Maybe, they were in on it together. Maybe, JM was talked into doing something. There is just to many pieces to the puzzle, to many questions. That’s why they want to talk to JM, to see what he knows, to find out what really happened that night. Maybe, he seen something that night, that he doesn’t even realize is important, but could lead to the right direction. However, they were led to his car, and whatever they found in that car, led to the search of his apartment. They found SOMETHING in that car. And some of the things that have come up are highly suspicious. Hopefully, this will come to an end soon, and Hannah can come home.

He should go and talk to the investigators, turn himself in for the reckless driving charge, he can take an attorney with him.   When a person is wanted by the authorities and that person runs, it makes them look guilty and it makes them look like they have something to hide.   He can take a lie detector test, it would be fastest way to clear himself.

If I were afraid of cops I certainly would not want to meet a whole group of them, possibly at night, alerted to my presence or vehicle.
Road block, raid on a family member’s house, surrounding the motel I am hiding in–it doesn’t make sense.

You are exaggerating a lot there.   However, running from the law and refusing to talk to authorities has cast suspicion upon himself.
At this point, Matthew is guilty of giving alcohol to a minor, plus driving without a license…and driving recklessly.
If he did not harm her himself, Matthew may be connected to ruthless people who harmed or kidnapped Hannah Graham.

If I’m a scrawny little guy (regardless of color) who just watched JM put his hands/arms around this woman I suspected as having issues of some sort…1) I’m sure as $#@$ not going to tap some 6’+ 270lb-er on the shoulder and say, “hey…you guys friends or is this a booty call??” lest I wanna get me arse placed firmly over my head like earmuffs 2) It’s perfectly conceivable (to the unknowing) that he & Hannah were friends or more – don’t forget how needy and clingy drunks can be…I’ve met few drunks who didn’t love everyone and 3) If she seemed visible disoriented/upset and then so easily approaches someone with an outstretched arm, why wouldn’t he think they knew each other or maybe were reuniting after an argument, who knows. I think I’d have done the same thing he did (and I’m a woman) – assumed she was in the safe hands of a friend/acquaintance and turned the other way. Look, unfortunately, these days, good Samaritans have to be careful too. Many kind-hearted people have been sued or have incriminated themselves just for trying to help someone which is why, even when people see a crime going on right in front of them, they turn and look the other way. They don’t want to get involved thanks to the lawyers and the legal system. People have had their lives/careers ruined by little more than allegations. I don’t blame the white guy for laying back to see where she goes or if she meets up with someone. He could’ve approached her with very honorable intentions only to have her freak out (remember, she was “disoriented”) on him and now HE’S having to explain why he was “stalking” her to the police and, ultimately, the press. Nope, I don’t blame him one bit for behaving the way he did. He saw her walk right into the arms of a guy who could knock him into tomorrow so he turned and left. Makes perfect sense.

georgiafl ~ I agree wholeheartedly,  IF JM is innocent, there would be a believable explanation for the evidence LE has in their possession/his attorney could explain it away.    It’s unlikely if JM turned himself in, he could make bail in this case depending on  how strong the evidence is & he knows that, little incentive for turning himself in if he is indeed responsible for Hannah’s disappearance imo.
The longer a victim is exposed to  the elements or buried, valuable evidence can be lost r degraded.  Sadly, I don’t think Hannah is alive as it’s difficult to keep victims alive unless there is an accomplice keeping them tied up/fed/etc. in a safe house.    I pray I’m wrong but Iive  followed  most high profile missing person cases/murders my entire adult life  & rarely ever is there a wonderful story like the Cleveland 3 that had been held hostage 10 + yrs. or J Dugard.    Usually, the victims are dead & some never found.

Maybe Jesse Matthew.  How long has he had dreadlocks?Do they know each other?There is also a connection between randy Taylor and Samantha Clark. He called her 5 times the night she went missing. Is their some sort of gang or sex trafficking?  There were several men following Heather the night of her disappearance.

DrMaryLee: you are there, on the ground. Maybe you can follow up on the matter of this white guy who is either a Samaritan or a devil. Who is he? Does he have a criminal record? Have their been any police sketches from other abductions that resemble him? Does he have an alibi? Does it check out? Is he on videos soon after his creepy video appearance? What do local employees there say? They are your neighbors. You can find out who was working that night, or who has access to security footage.
What does the law know? you can file a FOI request to get this guy’s name and statement, etc.
Myself, I think his story sounds reasonable. I might do the same thing as this white guy – watch a staggering coed in order to figure out if I need to alert the popo, or if she is simply heading back to meet up with friends. If I saw her being the least bit friendly with a guy, I would assume that the guy was a friend, maybe a boyfriend – and I would discontinue being watchful right then and there.
Myself, I would not carry on being suspicious and watchful if the guy were Black, versus white. To me, this is not bizarre. The man’s story – to whatever degree it is true – is that Hanna and Matthew were friendly.
Myself, if in tis situation, and Hanna seemed to act like she was uncomfortable, or protesting the harassment, like telling the guy to shove off, I would probably begin looking for security or dialing 9-11.
In the video he appears creepy. Sure, he could have raped and killed her that night, or may have her hidden away in a secret torture lair.
Keep reporting your findings and hypotheses here, where it seems like evidence and reason will be applied, even though there are racist comments peppered throughout by some commenters.
In your post, you state your hypothesis as if it were true. You may want to cast things as a bit more hypothetical or conjectural.
Some white people commit these types of crimes, and some Black people do. This website is countering a big problem we have here in America – the hesitancy to logically address a Black suspect in the same way as a white suspect, just because many of us whites are afraid of being labeled “racist.” This is what we mean by “PC.”
It is fine for you to stick up for this innocent-until-proven-guilty Black suspect, especially when there is a white suspect apparently in play.
You are on the ground. You can fill in the story to make the case. People will listen.

The white guy is the one who turned police onto the location of Hannah..  He went to them before any video was released.  Without him going to the police, they likely wouldn’t have known that it was Hannah in that video (have you seen it?  It’s really fuzzy).  The police did check him out.  He said he was meeting friends on the mall.  His friends corroborated his story.  At a time after the encounter with the white dude, Hannah and LJ went into a bar on the mall.  He bought drinks for them both and they left together.  As far as the police know, that’s the last time anyone saw Hannah.

About that police sketch – Is that gray hair around the edge of the hair line?
Could that be Jesse Leroy Matthew, Sr.?
Does anyone have a photo or mug shot of the father?

My Thoughts Thank you #The Last Democrat – I want the person responsible for this to be brought to justice whomever he/she is; I;m just not pleased with the tactics and quite disappointed because I do know Chief Longo personally and feel that his emotions are overriding best professional practices at this moment. I am 100% confident that none of his actions are racially motivated – he is not racist (at least in the ten years I’ve known and had occasion to work with him I’ve never felt or detected racism). His actions are solely (I believe) out of his heart-felt compassion about this tragedy.I just don’t want him to become blindsided by his emotions. I do plan to do what I can for justice in this matter (I do know one person can make a difference) – however, I want to hear the forensic results. I want the right person who is responsible for Hanna’s disappearance to be brought to justice. My Thoughts.

These officers are professionals with years of experience, and with the past actions of killers of that region.  They also know the stats about murder, sexual assault and kidnapping.   Except for psychopath serial killers, according to statistical evidence, most murderers and rapists are of the African-American ethnicity and/or Islamic persuasion.
Though Chief Longo was emotional during the press conference, I have no doubt they are being guided by emotion rather than carefully evidence and facts of this case.   This case isn’t an attempted lynching like was perpetrated by black activists in Sandford, FL  and is being perpetrated in Ferguson, MO.

Having executed three search warrants targeting Mathews its apparent police have more than just a hunch about this guy and so does the judge who is signing those warrants. That Mathews is a fugitive also doesn’t look good.

{Forgive the length but I had to respond as well. Breaking into 2 parts}
@DrMarylee,
Upon first hearing the “white guy’s” story, I truly thought it was total baloney. How he followed her was just creepy. Why not approach? offer to call a friend for her, alert another female, or put her in a taxi < (pardon the irony). At least call police to report possible assistance needed- who & where to find her.
I can agree it's rather curious if he was so concerned, why walk away from w/o verifying?
And when police were vague on any description beyond- "a black man," yet white guy/witness was "not a suspect." I really thought they were bluffing to set him up.
The delay in press re this witness, assumed he'd waited to come fwd. And only after CCTV videos were being released. Like he better act fast, before he was seen too.
And Yet, per CPD, this witness had already called the tip line on day 1. And he came into police HQ on his own, early in the investigation, & openly spoke with. Also, the witness had an alibi for the rest of that night, & it checked out.
On the flip-side, you had Jesse Matthew. By no coincidence, did he just happen to stumble upon Hannah in that courtyard.
In footage: first we see white guy, then Hannah stumble past, & last Jesse passes camera & circles in- a short distance behind Hannah. I don't doubt Jesse had zeroed in on her & was following, well before this point.
In this same time-period, white guy/witness was said to notice her stumbling, seeming disoriented. So now he begins to follow her. But for how long & how far?
At which point, after all 3 were seen on camera, did Jesse grab her? Did he first follow? or wait up ahead, & then intercept?
Upon Hannah passing the jewelery store, Jesse (after police debate on shadows vs person) had by then engaged her. So he's captured walking beside.
To me, her wide step/stride looks like someone running, or about to. at least picking up pace to put some distance btwn them.
Regardless, they were said to have entered Tempo bar. If her pace was as perceived, having any wits about her, she may have suggested, or agreed to go into bar bc it's a public place. perhaps realizing she couldn't shake him? or alcohol had rendered her helpless to react in any usual manner.
Knowing she's clearly intoxicated, highly possible she's blacked out. (any friends report how much she had at parties?) Does he slip her something in her drink?? Or if she's on brink of blackout, 1 drink can send you into a blackened state of oblivion. Basic motor skills still functioning, even rambling some coherent dialogue… all while not consciously processing any of it.
But Where is any footage at the bar? exiting & thereafter?

I watched live-stream PC #3. Press ask on witnesses or videos of the 2 getting into his car? Note chief is fairly adamant he thinks they did. He turns to state police rep & asks (paraphrasing) “are you ready to…  (pauses & starts again)… “if we have evidence of this- are we willing to share that info at this time?” Cop answers “uh, We’re not… uh… no, we’re not prepared to share those details at this time.”
The insinuation is obvious. And it reflects really bad for & onto JM. Bc he took the stance that he & Hannah parted ways on exiting bar (told to his mother).
Common sense tells us, this doesn’t mesh with his aggressive pursuit of hannah prior to bar. Or his efforts to take advantage of her inebriated condition- grabbing her, & leading her places. To only ply a lost, underage stranger with more alcohol– she clearly didn’t need! And At 32, working in a hospital- he knew better. His actions reflect some sinister type agenda, in taking advantage of her condition.
Back to the witness. I’m still not certain of his innocence. Scary to think if he was a predator, but JM beat him to it. Could fate be so evil & twisted that 2 sick perps were in pursuit simultaneously? If so, then there’s far more bad guys out there than we could ever imagine!
One point still bothers me… both guys, the very last 2 people to have interaction with, both show at the nearly exact same time on film- In the exact same area? Despite her wandering a good distance lost. So One is just ahead of, making sure she doesn’t see him. The other not so far behind her. Wondering if they were casing her together? This Would explain white guy’s sudden contradictory lack of concern, abandoning his efforts of self professed nobility.
Everything JM has done during & since is highly sketchy. And past cases keep pointing towards his direction, a serial type pattern.
It’s not about race, it’s about suspicious actions by The most likely suspect. And with Cameras, internet, & cellphones Filming and tracking everywhere, everyone, & everything, The facts come out almost instantaneously. Presumed innocent- just doesn’t apply in the same manner it originated. It’s now more a prove your innocence- by having damn good explanations for the evidence speaking for you.

Charlottesville native here…it’s scary stuff.
I’m not white or black. But the black community in Charlottesville does NOT trust the police. I had black friends in HS who were regularly racially profiled. JM’s flight does not cast him in a good light, but it doesn’t necessarily prove guilt. I believe the majority of the black Charlottesville community would have reacted the same way, if placed in this position. The media and the mob community want a head…and they think it’s JM right now.

Everybody thinks JM is guilty because he acting guilty, he was the last person to see her, and other weird coincidences. If he’s not, I’ll be the first to apologize. But, I want to throw this out there. He was a cab driver, he had to have some type of I.D. identifying him as a cab driver. What if he still had that I.D and that’s how he got Hannah in his car, with the promise of driving her home, and she trusted him because of that I.D. He was driving a cab when Morgan disappeared. What if he seen her walking around that night, stopped and told her he would give her ride. She gets into his cab, never to be seen again. Intriguing?

Chief Longo said at the Press Conference that they have issued a Warrant for Jesse Matthew Junior for abduction of Hannah Graham.   He did not take questions.  He said they were waiting for test results that they would have in a couple of days.  He also said they were continuing the search for Hannah.

And with “attempt to defile” which basically means sex crime. So they have to something in order to charge him that in addition to abduction. DNA, that potentially links him to other sex crimes?

When was he a cab driver? And the guy who he worked for as a cab driver said his self that a cab driver knows all the crooks and crannies better than the police do because they are in the car more than them. Morgan may have been picked up by a cab after she couldn’t get back in. Alexis may have been picked up by a cab. Since most of them were on  29 and UVA where cabs frequently travel. Maybe something they need to check out. I pray they find them alive and if not then to give the families closer.
