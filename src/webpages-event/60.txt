        LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WUSA9) -- Hannah Graham is the fifth young woman in five years to have vanished within miles of Route 29, the main highway through Charlottesville.Local law enforcement along with FBI are looking into the possibility that Jesse Leroy Mathew, the abduction suspect in the disappearance of the University of Virginia student, may be connected to the others, a law enforcement source told CBS News.Jesse Matthew, 32, was arrested Wednesday in Galveston, Texas and is charged in the disappearance of Hannah Graham, an 18-year-old student who has been missing since Sept. 13.The source said that investigators are looking at one or two of the missing women in particular to see if there is a possible link between Matthew and their disappearances.The body of one woman has been recovered.Nineteen-year-old Samantha Ann Clarke, who vanished after leaving her Orange County town house in September 2010, 19-year-old DaShad Laquinn Smith, who disappeared in Charlottesville in November 2012, and 17-year-old Alexis Murphy, who was last seen near Lynchburg, Va. in August of 2013 and whose car was found in Charlottesville, remain missing.Randolph Taylor was convicted in May of Murphy's abduction and murder, though her body has never been found. Nelson County Commonwealth's Attorney Anthony Martin said in a statement that he believed there was no evidence to suggest Matthew was involved in Murphy's disappearance.Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student, disappeared from the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena while attending a rock concert in October 2009. Her remains were found three months later in a rural area. In 2012, the FBI released a sketch of a man they believe is responsible for killing Harrington, but no arrests have been made.  The sketch came from the victim in a 2005 Fairfax City rape case."It is a crazy, startling cluster-phenomenon, which it may be, but I don't see so many coincidences in my life," said Gill Harrington, the mother Morgan Harrington.  She and Trina Murphy, Alexis's aunt, are doing interviews to encourage people to search for Hannah Graham and provide any possible tips that might help the investigation to authorities.According to police, Graham met friends at a restaurant for dinner Sept. 12 before stopping by two parties at off-campus housing units. Officials said she left the second party alone and sent a text message to a friend saying she was lost.
