CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Jesse Matthew, the man suspected of abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, has been forensically linked to another young woman’s disappearance. Sister station WTVR reports forensic evidence belonging to Graham matched evidence collected during the investigation of Morgan Harrington’s disappearance in 2009.
Twenty-year-old Harrington was a student at Virginia Tech who disappeared outside of Jon Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville on October 17, 2009, her body was later found at a farm in January of 2010. In an email obtained by WTVR, Virginia State Police said that Matthew’s arrest provided a significant break in the Harrington case.
WTVR reports that it sources have not indicated what Matthew may have done to or with Harrington, but the evidence shows that Harrington and Matthew had some sort of contact on the night she disappeared in 2009. Her mom told the TV station that they’ve waited five years for this kind of break in the case and implored the public to continue supplying tips in Graham’s current disappearance.
Graham was reported missing on September 14 after last being seen on September 13. Less than a week later, Matthew’s car and apartment were searched. During the investigation, police received more forensic evidence that pointed to Matthew as a suspect, and on September 24 he was found about 1,300 miles away from Charlottesville on the Bolivar Peninsula of Texas.
Matthew has since been extradited to Virginia and been charged with abduction with intent to defile in Graham’s disappearance, he’s also been charged with giving false information to a police officer. He’s due in court on Thursday to face the abduction charge.
A $100,000 reward for information leading to her safe return is being offered by authorities. If you have information that may be of use to the investigation, call (434) 295-3851 or 1-800-THE LOST.
