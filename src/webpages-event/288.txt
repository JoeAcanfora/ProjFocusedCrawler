Hannah Graham Case: New Charges for Suspect in UVA Student Case





































Police have announced new charges against a man seen in a surveillance video with missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. The suspect Jesse Matthew, 32, was the last person to see Graham, 18, before she vanished early on Sept. 13.At a press conference on Tuesday evening, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo said they are charging Matthew with abduction with the intent to defile. A warrant was obtained for his arrest on those charges earlier Tuesday afternoon, Longo said.Previously, Matthew was considered as a person of interest in the case but was wanted on reckless driving charges for speeding away from a Charlottesville police station Saturday after a brief interview by investigators.On Monday, police executed a second search of Matthew's apartment and left with several bags of evidence. Matthew, a patient technician in the operating room at the university's medical center, was not home at the time; he has not been seen since Saturday.Despite the new charges, Longo said that police "absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah even as we speak."Charlottesville Police Department A wanted poster for Matthew Jesse LeroyIN-DEPTHHannah Graham Case: Police Search Jesse Matthew's Apartment AgainWhat Happened to Hannah Graham?
