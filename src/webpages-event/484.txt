Missing Washington teen found safe, sheriff’s office says

CAMUS, Wash. — A missing 17-year-old girl who left behind ominous messages at her Camas home has been found safe, the Clark County Sheriff’s Office said Wednesday night.
Anji Dean walked away from her home June 23. However, her family said she sent messages to her boyfriend saying, “I’ve been in something for a long time and I haven’t told you,” later adding, “They were going to kill you and my family.”
Dean’s mother said she also found a binder with three letters Dean left behind, addressed to the family.
“The first letter said, ‘If you’re reading this, I’m missing or dead,'” her mom said.
It was signed by the teen and read, “When or if you find me, I’ll be all used up or dead.”
Deputies said she was found at the Clackamas Town Center shopping mall in Happy Valley, Ore., but did not immediately provide any information about the circumstances surrounding her disappearance.
Detectives contacted Dean at the mall, interviewed her and then reunited her with her family in Clark County.
Deputies said the investigation into her disappearance is continuing.
“This is an active investigation that includes the crime of human trafficking,” according to a Clark County Sheriff’s Office release.

Ok…. I might get some hateful responses but girls this age just like to go off with friends or just go off with a guy their family might not approve off. I truly believe this type of posts are might for younger girls who wouldn’t be considered runaways.

I’m assuming being so close to Vancouver and Portland you mean Camas…
Hope she’s found.

She’s in cali by now. Russians n pisas run the ring. She will be alive but drugged n brain washed. Sad but I know the game she got herself into. Shes too valuable to them to kill.

Sounds like she left because her parents may have had some rules she didn't like, or this is just a way for he to get attention, I guess we will know when more details are released.
