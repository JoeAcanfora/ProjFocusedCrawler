As the search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham continues, new forensic evidence surfaced on Sept. 29, that ties her suspected abductor, Jesse Matthew to the 2009 murder of Virginia Tech student, Morgan Harrington.
Jesse Matthew, 32, the prime suspect in the Sept. 13, abduction of 18-year-old University of Virginia student, Hannah Graham has been linked by new forensic evidence that provides a “significant break” in the 2009 disappearance and murder of Virginia Tech student, Morgan Harrington.

Jesse Matthew Hannah Graham Suspect — New Evidence Shows Ties To Morgan Harrington Murder
ABC reports that police announced on Sept. 29, that Jesse has some connection to Morgan’s death. Morgan was a student at Virginia Tech who disappeared on Oct. 17, 2009 she disappeared after attending a Metallica concert in Charlottesville, Virginia near the University of Virgina.

Virginia State spokeswoman, Corinne Geller said in a statement, “For the past five years, the Virginia State Police has been aggressively pursuing the investigation into the disappearance and death of 20-year-old Morgan D. Harrington of Roanoke, Va. Last week, the arrest of Jesse L. Matthew Jr., 32, of Charlottesville, Va., provided a significant break in this case with a new forensic link for state police investigators to pursue,” the site reported.

As Daily Mail reports, “Morgan’s brutal murder has already been linked by DNA to the rape of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia in September 2005.”
“If the link between Morgan’s disappearance and Matthew is confirmed, the 32-year-old will be accused of the abduction, rape or sexual assault of at least four young women over a 14-year period,” the site reports.
Fox News reports that Morgans remains were discovered three months after her October, 17  disappearance on a farm 10 miles outside of Charlottesville.
Police did not say specifically what the forensic link is, but said, “evidence belonging to Matthew matched material collected during the Harrington investigation,” according to Fox.
Jesse Matthew Arrested One Day After Being Charged With Hannah Graham’s Abduction
On Sept. 24, Jesse was arrested in Texas, just one day after he was charged with Hannah’s abduction. As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, Chief Longo told NBC News, “This case is nowhere near over. We have a person in custody, but a long road ahead of us,” he stated. “We’re asking every person within the sound of my voice to find Hannah.”
Jesse will appear in court on Oct. 2, in Virginia to face the charges of abduction with intent to defile Hannah.

If this is true, I fear that white people will start rioting everywhere, looting stores, smashing windows, etc.  Very possible that Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson will demand a life sentence for Jesse Matthew and justice for what he likely did to Hannah Graham and the others.  They will likely instigate the 1,000’s of white rioters.
