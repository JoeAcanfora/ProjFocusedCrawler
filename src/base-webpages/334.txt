LEGEND: 
CALABARZON  - Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon.
*  - Official estimates death toll up to 8,000; missing persons were presumed dead, some maybe devoured by sharks at Ormoc Bay & Camotes Sea.
** -  Includes those who perished in the sinking of M/V Princess Of The Stars and various fishing fleets in the Visayan Sea.
*** - Deaths of up to 3,000 with many bodies buried under mudslides at Surigao del Norte and southern Negros Occidental.
**** - Official estimates death toll of up to 1,200; many of those unrecovered were buried under tons of lahar from Mayon Volcano.
@ - Excluded are the 100+ people killed when M/V Doña Marilyn capsized at the coast of Masbate.
  

1 -  Only a Tropical Storm.
2 -  The typhoon unusually maintained winds of at least 240 kph for 60 hours, most of it while over land.
3 -  Had a very erratic movement causing numerous forecasting errors catching millions off-guard at its path. Induced monsoon rains spawned floods in Western and Central Mindanao.
4 -  The most powerful typhoon ever recorded by PAGASA, registering a 320-kph wind gust at Virac Weather Station before the anemometer was damaged. It erased the old record of       275 kph, recorded during the passage of Super Typhoon SENING (Joan) in Oct 13, 1972 at the same station.
5 -  A very large super typhoon with a radius covering the whole Philippines.
6 -  Criss-crossed Northern Luzon making initial landfall at Cagayan, then looping back to landfall in Ilocos Norte, looped back again and entered Cagayan the second time.
7 -  Brought record flooding in Antipolo, Cainta, Marikina, Quezon City, Manila, Pasig, and much of Metro Manila drowning hundreds, stranding millions.



over water   typhoon's estimated strongest winds were recorded while typhoon was still at sea but is closely approaching land.


Note: Damages registered in billions of Philippine Peso are not adjusted to current inflation rate.Bold font indicate new entries.
