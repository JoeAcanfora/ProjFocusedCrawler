A busy week. Note the item immediately under this:
“CUBA SWEPT BY HURRICANE
A great Caribbean hurricane descended on Cuba yesterday with winds of more than 100 miles an hour and waves 200 feet high.”

Philippines climate commissioner Naderev Saño: 
“Science tells us that simply, climate change will mean more intense tropical storms. As the Earth warms up, so do the oceans. The energy that is stored in the waters off the Philippines will increase the intensity of typhoons and the trend we now see is that more destructive storms will be the new norm. … What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness. The climate crisis is madness. We can stop this madness.”  —The Patriot Post

He can indeed stop the madness.
All he has to do is shut up.
