The tiny island of Baligiuan, in the Philippines, is home to about 200 families—and it was completely underwater at some point during Typhoon Haiyan, like many low-lying islands.
The coral atoll in the Visayan Sea is 10 miles from the shore, in the heart of the area hardest hit. More than a million homes have been damaged, and many are still without proper shelter.




 How You Can Help: Typhoon Haiyan




This video from Concern Worldwide shows the amazing resilience of the island dwellers, who manage to keep spirits high as they work to rebuild. 
Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines on Nov. 8, unleashing winds and rains that lashed the tropical island nation, affecting nearly 10 million people.
Thousands remain unaccounted for, and more than 5,500 have died since the storm. Many were buried in mass graves, still unidentified.
Baliguian's devastation is one story among many: There are more than 7,100 islands in the archipelago nation.
