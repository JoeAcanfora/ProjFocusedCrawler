Philippines Typhoon update: Torrential levels of rainfall increase risk of “catastrophic” flooding and landslides, International Rescue Committee partners roll out needs assessments across the country




Manila, Philippines 07 Dec 2014 - As Typhoon Hagupit made its second landfall on December 7 in the Cataingan municipality, Masbate province, the IRC is rolling out needs assessment teams across the country, with local partners set to assess the damage and necessary aid response. Sites include Leyte, Ormoc, Cebu, Samar and the Bicol Region including Legazpi. The Typhoon has forced up to one million people to evacuate from low lying coastal areas, with many smaller isolated communities not yet accounted for. Melanie Teff, the IRC’s spokesperson in Manila said, “We continue to prepare for worst-case scenarios. This slow moving Typhoon is dumping torrential and potentially catastrophic levels of rainfall throughout the archipelago, so the IRC is on high alert to respond with our local partners to flooding and landslides. Where the storm has passed we will be focusing aid distributions where they are needed on hygiene, safe drinking water, and economic support like cash distributions.” Hagupit is moving very slowly West North-West, at a speed of 10kph. Storm signals are currently up in 43 areas in Luzon and Visayas. The typhoon's third landfall is expected tomorrow in Northern Mindoro. Potential storm surges are up to 3 meters high. Weather experts believe the typhoon will make six landfalls in total across the Philippines – including Sibuyan Island, Romblon, Tablas Island and Oriental Mindoro - until it exits the country in several days time. The IRC has launched a donation appeal page to support emergency relief work across a region still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan. To join IRC partners on the ground assessments and aid distributions in the Philippines please contact Tyler.Jump@rescue.org / +63 927 652 4644. To speak to IRC spokespeople available in Manila, Cebu, New York, London or Washington DC please contact Oliver.Money@rescue.org / +1 646 318 7307. The International Rescue Committee helps people whose lives and livelihoods are shattered by conflict and disaster to survive, recover, and gain control of their future.
