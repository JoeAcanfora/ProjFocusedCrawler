Schools and offices were shut in parts of the central Philippines and residents stocked up on supplies and food, as provinces yet to recover from last year’s devastating super-typhoon Haiyan braced for another category 5 storm.
Typhoon Hagupit was churning across the Pacific less than 600 miles east of the country on Thursday, packing winds of up to 120mph and gusts of up to 140mph. It was expected to strengthen to a category 5 storm before slamming into Eastern Samar province in the central Philippines on Saturday.
Eastern Samar and Leyte island were worst-hit in November 2013 by Haiyan, one of the strongest storms to make landfall, which left more than 7,000 dead or missing and more than 4 million homeless or with damaged houses.
Local government officials and emergency teams from the Red Cross, army and coastguard were braced for swollen rivers, landslides, flash floods, and storm surges, said Roger Mercado, governor of Southern Leyte province.
“All radios and televisions are open, cell phones are being charged. People are buying food stuff, preparing fuel and gasoline supply,” he told local radio station DZMM. “People are now conscious of preparations.”
The government said it had moved the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting next week from Legazpi to Manila to avoid the likely path of the typhoon.
While the local weather bureau and the Japan Meteorological Agency predicted Hagupit – the Filipino word for lash – would make a direct hit on the central Philippines, the forecasting website Tropical Storm Risk and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center of the US navy showed the storm veering north, closer to Manila.
The south-east Asian country was hardest hit by extreme weather in 2013, according the thinktank Germanwatch. Concerns over extreme weather have been exacerbated by an apparent shift in storm paths, with southern regions hit by powerful typhoons in the past three years.
About 20 typhoons strike the Philippines each year, most hitting the north along the main island of Luzon.
