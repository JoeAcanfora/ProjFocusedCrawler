UNDP Chief Helen Clark lauds Philippine Government  for excellent handling of Typhoon Hagupit

11 Dec 2014
UNDP ready to provide Philippine Government with technical assistance towards ensuring even stronger prevention, mitigation and response capacities.
In a letter to President Benigno S. Aquino III, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Administrator Ms. Helen Clark conveyed deep condolences to the people and Government of the Philippines for the loss of lives and devastation caused by Typhoon Hagupit (Ruby).
Ms. Clark also commended the highly effective precautionary measures put in place by the Philippine Government and local government units to prepare for a typhoon of this magnitude. These include the evacuation of close to one million people which saved countless lives.
Ms. Clark further said that “this extraordinary achievement is a clear reflection of the careful planning and strengthened institutional capacity of the relevant authorities. The Philippine Government’s approach to preparing and responding to this disaster presents an important model of building resilience for many other countries which are exposed to similar natural disasters and calamities.”
“The United Nations, including the UNDP, stands ready to support the Philippine Government and people of the Philippines as the affected communities rebuild their lives and livelihoods. UNDP is ready to provide the Philippine Government with technical assistance towards ensuring even stronger prevention, mitigation, and response capacities.”
