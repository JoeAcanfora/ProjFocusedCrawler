Aid agencies are rushing to get relief supplies to the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the powerful Typhoon Hagupit.The typhoon destroyed nearly 16,500 houses and damaged  more than 33,100 on the island of Samar before making its way slowly across the country. It has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and on Wednesday was headed for southern Vietnam.The national disaster agency said nine people were killed as the storm churned across the central islands and the southern  tip of the main island of Luzon. The Red Cross has confirmed 22 deaths. The health ministry and Red Cross were checking reports that nearly 40 people died."We're trying to reach upland villages ... but landslides and fallen trees make it difficult," said Richard Gordon, head of the Philippine Red Cross."We expect casualty figures to increase as we get more information on the ground."

 Over a million people fled to shelters ahead of the storm as authorities avoided a repeat of the devastation caused by Super Typhoon Haiyan last year, in which more than 7,350 people were killed.Interior minister Manuel Roxas, who is overseeing the government's typhoon response, said at least 200,000 people on the island needed help.He also said airports and main roadways had been cleared for the relief operation.Typhoon Hagupit totally damaged 6,200 houses and partially damaged 7,300 others, Mr Roxas said.In Catbalogan, a major city on Samar island's western side, thousands have started to sift through debris under the hot sun to rebuild their homes."Daily existence here is a struggle for those who are affected," mayor Stephany Uy-Tan told AFP.But food relief from the national government had begun to arrive as roads were cleared were debris, she said.Before Typhoon Hagupit struck, close to 21,000 people, or one-fourth of the city's population, were moved to shelters in an unprecedented evacuation effort, she said."We had a long time to prepare, that's very important," Ms Uy-Tan said.
