Mr. Tebow has also made the Philippines one of the primary beneficiaries of his outreach programs, First Coast News reported.Currently his foundation is working with CURE International to build an orthopedic children’s hospital in Davao City set to open next year.PHOTOS: See the devastating aftemath of super typhoon HaiyanThe hospital is one of the few places that survived the storm, but it is unable to provide assistance in the storm’s aftermath, because it is still in the process of being built, the Florida Times Union reported. Mr. Tebow’s organization is also working with his father’s foundation, the Bob Tebow Evangelistic Association, on church building and orphan care in the Philippines, First Coast News reported.Copyright © 2014 The Washington Times, LLC.
