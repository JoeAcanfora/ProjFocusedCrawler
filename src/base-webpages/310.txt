Bopha is  a large-sized tropical cyclone with a diameter of 720 kilometers across. The 24-hour rainfall accumulation near the center of Typhoon Bopha is estimated to be heavy (310 mm).

3-DAY FORECAST OUTLOOK* Super Typhoon Bopha is expected to continue moving generally west-northwest for the next 24 to 48 hours while maintaining its forward speed...and this motion will continue throughout the forecast period.  On the forecast track, the core of Bopha is expected to pass over or very close to Palau Islands early this evening between 7:00-8:00 am Philippine Time...and could be over or very close to Surigao City and Siargao Islands on Tuesday afternoon around sunset. Bopha may start to traverse Central Visayas Tuesday evening, passing in between Bohol and Southern Leyte...and cross Central Cebu after midnight on Wednesday...and over Negros Oriental very near Sagay and Cadiz Cities around sunrise on Wednesday.
Bopha will continue gaining strength during the next 12 to 24 hours...and could become a Category 5 Super Typhoon. A decrease in its strength is forecast beginning Tuesday morning as Bopha moves into an area of lower Ocean Heat Content (OHC) or slightly cooler sea-surface temperatures and begin interaction with the land mass of Mindanao and the Visayas on Wednesday.
