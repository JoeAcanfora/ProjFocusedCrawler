Typhoon Aftermath: What I Saw After Haiyan
David Page's photos and report, exclusive to TakePart.com, from one of the first medical relief teams to reach survivors of Typhoon Haiyan.

Desperate for food and water, survivors of Typhoon Haiyan rush the Philippine Air Force helicopters delivering our medical team and equipment.
Deep tension and anxiety are in the air, but we are warmly welcomed.

An assistant to the mayor of Tanauan escorts Dr. Mike Karch and our advance team on the long portage from the landing zone to the town hall. Because the roads have been destroyed, it is the only way into town.
By late Sunday night, most major obstacles to vehicular traffic have been removed.

During the first 72 hours after the storm, all through traffic on the Pan-Philippine Highway between Tanauan and points south ended here. Only bicycles, motorcycles, and pedestrians were able to pass.
All infrastructure is paralyzed, including power, water, food-supply chains, and communication. The first corpses we glimpsed were floating in the river beneath this bridge.

Our medical team would soon learn that a high percentage of major trauma injuries were caused by roofing tin dislodged in the typhoon's record-breaking winds. Many victims rushed downstairs to seek refuge from flying debris, only to be trapped in the massive surge of water that followed. Those who survived suffered infections due to the lack of immediate medical care.

Dr. Mike Karch, who was also one of the first doctors on the scene at ground zero after 9/11, briefs the team before commencing operations at the makeshift field hospital we set up in Tanauan Town Hall, 72 hours after the storm.
This is where we will sleep at night until rain forces us to decamp to a covered bedroom in a neighboring house.

Monday morning, survivors line up peacefully on Real Street in front of the town hall for emergency medical care and to register missing and dead family members.

Dr. Martha Kim, OB-GYN, uses a mobile ultrasound unit to monitor fetal status and position in a complicated and protracted labor that ultimately goes to cesarean section.

The anesthesia team places a preoperative epidural for an emergency cesarean section to be performed at night, beneath a tarp we strung up to keep out the pouring rain. Both mother and baby are saved.
The main operating theater is set up as a "triage tube" modeled after the freestanding Maryland Shock Trauma Hospital, first developed in World War II.

Threatening skies, unconfirmed reports of another tropical storm impending, and rumors of nearby pillaging by the Communist New People's Army keep anxiety high through Tuesday.

Mayor Pel Tecson would drive each morning to the Tacloban airport to secure what limited food and water relief he could for his town of 50,000 people.
Here, survivors line up peacefully for municipal drinking water rations.

5 Rad Ways to Upcycle Old Telephone Booths
Unless you’re Clark Kent, chances are you don’t even notice the public phone booths on the street anymore. With their technology all but obsolete, those metal boxes would appear to have little value. But some creative minds are giving the booths a second life by finding innovative ways to repurpose them.
In April, officials in New York City held a contest asking designers to submit ideas for reinventing the 11,000 pay phones still standing on the streets of the Big Apple.
Participants devised ways to turn the structures into mini information centers, subway card dispensers, bike racks, and electric-vehicle charging posts. One proposal suggested reimagining phone booths as miniature gardens, the walls covered in live moss.
Throughout the world, others have come up with innovative concepts for converting infrequently used booths into art projects, shower stalls, and furniture—proving that the more we use what we already have, the less we waste, and the better off we might just all be.

On November 10, approximately 58 hours after Typhoon Haiyan smashed into the central Philippines, my team from Mammoth Medical Missions climbed out of a pair of Philippine Air Force Sokol helicopters onto a debris-strewn beach just south of the Municipality of Tanauan.
A crowd of survivors—desperate for food, water, and medical care—was assembled there. Four flights eventually ferried our group of 16 doctors and nurses and more than 35 bags of medical supplies and equipment from what was at the time a mere skeleton airport at Tacloban, 30 miles north.
Ours was the first relief team of any kind to arrive. These original and never-before-published photos show some of what we saw and experienced over the following four days, as we did what we could to establish a functioning field hospital on the second floor of a storm-ravaged town hall. 
More photos and a full, feature-length article are forthcoming at TakePart.com.
