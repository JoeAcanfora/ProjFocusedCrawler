The typhoon, which made landfall in Eastern Samar late Saturday, is moving slowly, dumping heavy rain that could trigger landslides and more flash flooding. At least three people have died, with local radio stations suggesting that number could be higher in Eastern Samar and Iloilo, where some reports of deaths are yet to be confirmed by officials or the Red Cross.Among those killed by the typhoon were a baby and a woman who died of hypothermia in Iloilo yesterday. Another person died after being hit by a falling tree in the eastern town of Dolores, where the typhoon first made landfall

Two women were also hurt by another falling tree when it struck the tricycle taxi they were riding on in central Negros Oriental province.Traumatised by the massive death and destruction caused by Typhoon Haiyan - which struck just a year ago, killing thousands - more than 800,000 people fled to around 1,000 emergency shelters as the government, backed by the 120,000-strong military, tried to maintain a degree of calm.Rhea Estuna, a 29-year-old mother of one, fled on Thursday to an evacuation center in Tacloban - the city hardest-hit by Haiyan last year - and waited in fear as Hagupit's wind and rain lashed the school where she and her family sought refuge. When she peered outside Sunday, she said she saw a starkly different aftermath than the one she witnessed last year after Haiyan struck.

 Floodwater sweeping through towns could cause humanitarian problems, with emergency aid workers on standby'There were no bodies scattered on the road, no big mounds of debris,' she said. 'Thanks to God this typhoon wasn't as violent.'Haiyan's tsunami-like storm surges and killer winds left thousands of people dead and levelled entire villages, most of them in and around Tacloban.Nearly a dozen countries, led by the United States and the European Union, have pledged to help in case of a catastrophe, disaster-response agency chief Alexander Pama said.The EU commissioner for humanitarian aid, Christos Stylianides, said a team of experts would be deployed to help assess the damage and needed response.'The Philippines are not alone as they brace up for a possible hardship,' Mr Stylianides said, adding that the European Commission was 'hoping that the impact will be less powerful than a year ago, when Typhoon Haiyan left a devastating imprint on the country.'

 A woman braves strong rain as she walks along an empty street hours before Typhoon Hagupit passes near the city of LegazpiDisplaced villagers were asked to return home from emergency shelters in provinces where the danger posed by the typhoon had waned, including Albay, where more than half a million people were advised to leave evacuation sites.Nearly 12,000 villagers, however, will remain in government shelters in Albay because their homes lie near a restive volcano.While officials expressed relief, they were quick to warn that Hagupit - Filipino for 'smash' or 'lash' - was still on course to barrel across three major central islands before starting to blow away Tuesday into the South China Sea.Several typhoon-lashed eastern villages isolated by downed telephone and power lines were out of contact, Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman said.'It's too early to tell,' Philippine Red Cross Secretary-General Gwendolyn Pang said. 'Let's cross our fingers that it will stay that way. It's too close to Christmas.'Army troops were deployed to supermarkets and major roads in provinces in the typhoon's path to prevent looting and chaos and clear debris, all of which slowed the government's response to Haiyan last year.Unlike past years, many people readily left high-risk communities ahead of Hagupit, Soliman said.He added: 'Haiyan was the best teacher of all. People did not need much convincing to move to safety. In fact, many of them volunteered to go.'
