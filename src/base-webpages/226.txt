@RupertDarwall The oil and coal industries and their media friends have been the key propagandists worldwide.

@klemanowicz @rupertmurdoch His newspapers and TV stations are relentlessly destructive and propagandistic on the topic.

Can @JeffDSachs show any causal link between Western climate scepticism and Copenhagen collapse? Looks blatantly unhistorical to me

@JeffDSachs @rupertmurdoch absolutely disagree at this tv station. You are making a blanket statement. That is unfair.

@JeffDSachs @RupertDarwall And big government enthusiasts (and rent-seeking hangers-on ) have been the cheerleaders on the other side.

In Feb 07 @JeffDSachs said new climate treaty will take effect in2013. Does he seriously think @rupertmurdoch caused his prediction to fail?
