Thursday, November 14, 2013 2:07 PM EST





MANILA -
            The Associated Press has withdrawn its report that the death toll in the Philippines has risen to 4,460. The figure the United Nations released as the death toll was incorrect. The number actually referred to U.N. evacuation centers.
The U.N. says some 920,000 people were displaced by the storm and a total of 11.8 million people have been affected.
