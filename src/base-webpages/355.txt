Super Typhoon Haiyan Is a Wake-Up Call for UN Climate Summit | Jamie Henn
•••
The alarmist Huffington Post, ever quick to blame humans for Typhoon Haiyan, or any *weather* event, forgot to read the latest findings from the IPCC. Their latest climate report AR5, concedes a “Low Confidence” link between extreme weather and man-made greenhouse gas emissions.
Official IPCC Words from SREX report released 2012 : ”We Do Not Know If The Climate Is Becoming More Extreme“
HuffPo’s human causation conclusion is not supported by IPCC AR5 or SREX.

Don’t expect Huffington Post or delegates at the upcoming UN climate propaganda gabfest COP19 to report or discuss the Philippines devastating history of Super Typhoons, with CO² well below 350ppm :

THOUSANDS OF LIVES LOST.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 27.—The typhoon which swept over the Philippine Islands on Oct. 6 was the cause of one of the worst disasters reported from the Southern Ocean In many years- Thousands of lives were lost, among those who perished being many Europeans, and the damage to property was something appalling.
The difficulty of getting news from the Islands is great at any time, and owing to the remoteness of some of the provinces visited by the hurricane full details of the 1st of November. The steamer Gaelic,  from the Orient to-day, brought letters and papers which contain accounts of the ravages of the tidal wave and the winds. Several towns were swept or blown away. Fully 400 Europeans were drowned, and it is estimated that 6,000 natives perished.
