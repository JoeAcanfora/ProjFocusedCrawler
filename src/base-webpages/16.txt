Storm churns towards Philippine capital 
Millions of people in the Philippine capital are hunkering down as a major storm that has so far killed at least 23 people churned towards the megacity.Soldiers and aid workers on Monday rushed to reach devastated coastal villages on Samar island, where Typhoon Hagupit crashed in from the Pacific Ocean at the weekend with winds of 210km/h.In Metro Manila, a sprawling coastal megalopolis of 12 million people that regularly endures deadly flooding, well-drilled evacuation efforts went into full swing as the storm approached on Monday."We are on 24-hour alert for floods and storm surges," Joseph Estrada, mayor of Manila, the original city of two million within Metro Manila, told AFP.Thousands of people, mostly the city's poorest residents who live in shanty homes along the coast and riverbanks, crammed into schools and other government evacuation centres across Metro Manila."I'm very afraid. Every time there's a storm we have no choice but to evacuate," Soledad Papauran, 60, who works as a waste picker at a Manila landfill.READ MORE

Typhoon sparks calls for climate action 
Filipinos have urged world leaders to act urgently on climate change during global talks, as the Philippines deals with its third typhoon in as many years.As loved ones braced for the full impact of Typhoon Hagupit back home, Filipino activists in Lima urged climate negotiators to act with more urgency in drafting a global plan to limit such potentially life-threatening events."To us in the Philippines, we are not any more debating on whether or not the impacts of climate change are here, we have experienced it," Voltaire Alferez of the Aksyon Klima Pilipinas NGO grouping said on the sidelines of the talks."Year after year we are bombarded ... from one typhoon to another," he told AFP as his wife and son of one year left their Manila home for the relative safety of higher ground.This is the third typhoon in a row to hit the Philippines during the annual, ministerial-level climate negotiations.READ FULL STORY

Reports of two dead after Typhoon Hagupit hits the Philippines 
Authorities in the Philippines said at least two people have been killed after typhoon Hagupit made landfall.Officials said two people were killed when the storm that lashed the eastern provincial city of Borongan.The category three storm is packing sustained winds of 175 kilometres per hour and wind gusts of 210kph.It made landfall in Dolores, a coastal town facing the Pacific in Eastern Samar province, according to the Philippines’ weather agency.The wind strength makes Hagupit the most powerful storm to hit the Philippines this year.Fearful of a repeat of last year when Super Typhoon Haiyan claimed more than 7,350 lives, the government had undertaken a massive evacuation effort ahead of Hagupit that saw millions seek shelter."This is it. I know you are tired, not enough sleep, not enough food, too much coffee," Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said a few hours before the typhoon hit, calling for a final effort to bring more people in vulnerable areas to safe shelters."This is our last push. Every person we can save now is one less we have to look for after the typhoon passes."Officials say two people have been killed in the eastern provincial city of Borongan.Hagupit was forecast to take three days to cut across the Philippines, passing over mostly poor central regions, while also bringing heavy rain to the densely populated capital of Manila slightly to the north.Damage assessments from communities initially hit are not likely to be known until after daybreak on Sunday, as power and mobile networks have been lost in those areas.Tens of millions of people live in the typhoon's path, including those in the central Philippines who are still struggling to recover from the devastation of Super Typhoon Haiyan, which hit 13 months ago.Haiyan was the strongest storm ever recorded on land, with winds of 315 kilometres an hour.It also generated tsunami-like storm surges that claimed more than 7350 lives, making it one of the Philippines' deadliest natural disasters.In Tacloban, one of the cities worst-hit by Haiyan, thousands of traumatised typhoon survivors crammed into schools, churches and other evacuation centres on Saturday.

Floods, landslides reported after Typhoon Hagupit makes landfall 
Filipino residents evacuate to safer ground in the town of Qinapondan, Samar island (AAP)Filipino residents evacuate to safer ground in the town of Qinapondan, Samar island (AAP)Rescue operations are underway in the Philippines after Typhoon Hagupit made landfall. Almost 700,000 people have been evacuated, and  communication lines and power services cut. Aid agency Oxfam said it is still too early to tell the extent of the damage.  "Teams are going in to look at how things have gone, and where support can be done. We are hearing stories about localised flooding," Oxfam Philippines country director, Justin Morgan told the ABC. The typhoon has weakened from a super typhoon to a category 3 storm. The typhoon is generating wind speeds of 175 kilometres per hour. Authorities warn that torrential rain and winds could last for days, with storm surges expected of up to 4.5 metres. Oxfam's Justin Morgan said the strong winds and rain is expected to hit a central belt of the Philippines for days. "We're also concerned that this typhoon - while it does not have the same wind power as Typhoon Haiyan a year ago," he said. "It is moving a lot slower and that means it moving over areas for a longer period of time causing more wind damage and also rain for longer periods of time."He said authorities and locals were better prepared this time than they were for Typhoon Haiyan, which claimed 700,000 lives when it struck a year ago. "The government and aid agenices alike are better set up to communicate with people on the ground. So the response in the first hour can be a lot better."
