More hype on Typhoon Haiyan – this time from Supermandia and Masters of Disaster

Anthony Watts / November 13, 2013 


Scott Mandia aka Supermandia crows in his Twitter feed this AM:

The graph from Weather Underground’s Masters of Disaster, Dr. Jeff Masters, follows. But there’s only one problem – one very important storm is missing from the list.


Hurricane expert Dr. Ryan Maue immediately points out:

And, then adds a reference list. But, watch how Supermandia put his foot in his mouth just like media did on confusing what units typhoon wind speed is reported in:

Source: https://twitter.com/AGW_Prof/status/400661282543513600
185 mph equals 160 knots, anyone who knows how to use Google can do this conversion easily by simply typing in this in the Google search box: 185mph to knots
You get this:

https://www.google.com/search?q=185mph+to+knots&ie=utf-8
And there are other confusing elements to the wind speed story. More on that later. Adding to the confusion, tt is also important to note that there have been THREE super typoon Joans, one in 1959, one in 1970, and one in 1997, plus a minor storm named Joan in 1964.
Supertyphoon Joan in 1959 was far stronger (160knots) than the one in 1970 (150knots) which Masters referenced in his list.

When I worked at the JTWC back in the 1980s, we had sat pics of Super Typhoon Pamela in 1976. From the northeast quadrant to the southwest quadrant it measured nearly 2500 miles. The eye was close to 50nm in diameter. It went off the Dvorak scales, but estimates put it above what hit the PI. Pamela never made landfall (we can thank God for that). And it was not mentioned in this piece.









JK says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 10:48 am					


So what was the max speed anyway?  I can only find reference to 150mph.

climatereason says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 11:00 am					


I have a much used book by Hubert Lamb entitled’ Historic Storms of the North Sea British Isles and Northwest Europe.’ In it storms back to the 1500’s are noted together with synoptic charts.
The typhoon data all seemed to relate to post 1950 which is hardly extensive.
If someone will link me to credible typhoon data post 1850 and the same info for pre 1850 events I will try and draw up a chart and determine whether the post 1850 one are larger than those that went before.
Can anyone supply the information, or are we all discussing only the most recent 60 year slice of typhoon history which proves nothing whatsoever about their strength relative to historic events.

Mandia made a mistake and acknowledged it. What’s wrong with that? It happens to all of us. Making a blog post out of it just makes you look bad.









dbstealey says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 11:15 am					


James,
Mandia has made a MAJOR, long running mistake in his promotion of climate alarmism.
When he acknowledges that mistake, I’ll pay more attention.









John says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 11:15 am					


Yes, when someone doesn’t know something, and when shown the right way, says thanks and acknowledges that he learned something, that is good.  Kind of 180 degrees from Michael Mann and his cronies.  So props to Mandia.
Props also to Ryan Maue and the others, who say we need a comprehensive, long term, peer reviewed paper to know if 195 is the tops.  It might be, or it might be tops only within the last several decades, or it might not be tops at all (given that Camille broke the wind speed indicator at 190 mph).  
Anyway, Haiyan was obviously extremely powerful.  On thing that iis important to me is whether we had storms this powerful in, or coming out of, the Little Ice Age.  There is certainly evidence of powerful major storms in that period, but to determine wind speed isn’t possible, it would only be possible to guessestimate based upon how big storm surges were, back in the day, and to compare if possible to Haiyan’s and Camille’s.   
That is basic science that could be done.  Ryan????

Since when is there such a thing as a “Super Typhoon”? I thought a typhoon was a typhoon. Next we need a “Super Duper Typhoon” moniker for the first storm that clocks (unofficially, as always) 196 mph. And what moniker comes after that?









brians356 says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 11:29 am					


Gosh, I read now on Wikipedia that “Super Typhoon” (coined by Hong Kong Observatory) is indeed a typhoon with winds of 100 knots. The US JTWC requires 130 knots for that classification.

Maybe Super Mandia would know.
(Probably the super was used to link it to superstorm Sandy and to the warmist meme of more severe storms.)

					November 13, 2013 at 11:41 am					


A large portion of my extended family (my in-laws) are from the island that was hit by the typhoon. Naturally I was reading the newspapers from the Philippines and so I learned that the Philippines government said the typhoon made landfall at 146 mph. (converted from kph) 
God damn it. What does it take to get such a simple thing straight?

Jeff Masters is terrible.









brians356 says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 11:57 am					


The death toll of ~2500 is a fair indication the actual winds were a lot lower than 195 mph. Looking at the photos, many relatively insubstantial (by US standard) buildings are still standing. I believe the guesstimates of 10,000 deaths was based on the expectations that 195 mph would literally flatten the city of Tacloban, and it clearly didn’t. Many houses still retain most of their roof. The damage I see in photos might be consistent with 150 mph winds. My subjective impression only.









JJ says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 11:59 am					


Has Mandia corrected the graphic?
No.
Has anyone addressed the 150 mph vs 195 mph discrepancy?
Have they addressed the differences between Haiyan (estimated by satellite) and the other large storms like Camille, TIp, and Allen (measured with aircraft)?

As it would appear from most reports that it as geography and storm surge that killed most of the casualties then the actual wind speed could look kinda moot.
I do wish that people would stop using this terrible event to promote THEIR particular AGW view (in either direction).
I also wish that everybody would get their facts straight before speaking out, but that is always going to be a futile wish.
My thoughts go to those still suffering the outcomes.

Leaving aside the idea that the experts should know what they are talking about, it would be nice if everyone used the same units.  No wonder the media, politicians, and the man on the street just trying to sort through information overload become confused.  Some reports are miles per hour; some are kilometres per hour.  Some are in Knots? Huh?  Sustained wind speed? Gust speeds? Sustained gusts?  Wait, what?
I know Nature loves to be capricious, but some standard or another would (hopefully) avoid confusion.

Thanks once again for providing a factual historical comparison. But the issue is for us surely is a moral one. The climate alarmists want to hector us from a pile of corpses of the poorest people on earth who were left by the Philippine government”s corruption and negligence to face a terrible force of nature unprotected. Could not Greenpeace et al just once have found it in their hearts not to have exploited the suffering and misery of the victims of a natural disaster? The response of the warmist ideologues is shameful. The Philippine government failed to protect and now is incapable of even burying its dead citizens. Its cries global warming while its suffering citizens starve. We are witnessing the moral bankruptcy of climate alarmism.

======================================================================
Displaying my ignorance again.
If I’m not mistaken, strong hurricane names are retired. (Based on damage, I think.)
Are typhoon names treated differently? Is that why there are so many “Joans”? Or did they all not cause major damage?









Auto says: 


					November 13, 2013 at 1:26 pm					


Myself, I use knots.  I’m in shipping – have been for a long time.
Anything over 64 knots is Beaufort Force 12 – a ‘hurricane’ [or Typhoon or other local name (local to three or four billion in East Asia, maybe)], ‘that which no canvas can withstand’.
Yolanda/Hayian, plainly, was a big one.
The biggest?
One of the biggest?
Doesn’t matter now, except to geeks like me who collect records.  [Apologies if anyone else here does that, too, but doesn’t like the ‘geek’ descriptor.]
Now, what does matter  . . . .  .  .   .   .
The Philippines is poor; lots of folk live by the water – as they make a “living” – a few dollars a day, plus fish – from the ocean.
A lot of Filipino men are at sea – probably over a million at any one time – perhaps 35 or 40 per cent of all merchant seafarers around the world, carrying your oil and iron ore and containers and gas..  Some live in the worst affected regions.  How do they feel today, days after the event, when they still cannot contact loved ones, or even neighbours?
And the Philippines need help, regardless of SuperManDia’s [one n or two?] graphic.
Please think of that.
If only there was a single point of reference that would get 85% or more of donations on to the ground in effective help, not lost in bureaucracies, kleptocracies etc.  
Security, shelter, water, food – and burial services, whatever the toll.
Those are needed now.
Please think of that.

I still wonder, what is considered a landfall?  I know Paka clobbered Guam, but fizzled before reaching Asia proper.  Would that count as a landfall or just an unfortunate blip in the path? That was one big blow.  I see now that the gust reading at Andersen has been discounted.  Figures, the anemometer broke off in the middle of the reading.  We were all quite impressed with that 236mph gust too…though not as much as by the damage.

I give up,
This cyclone had a sustained windspeed of 235kph with gusts to 275 kph that makes it a pretty ordinary category 4 cyclone
From the Australian government BoM
 Category 4 Severe Tropical Cyclone 	225 – 279 km/h
Very destructive winds 	Significant roofing and structural damage. Many caravans destroyed and blown away. Dangerous airborne debris. Widespread power failures. 
Make a note though, This notes that a category 4 Cyclone is very destructive particularly when in plows into a populated area, and even worse when it’s a poor populated area. For all the carry-on of ordinary storm sandy – which was not even a category 1 storm, this Cat4 storm is much, much more destructive. 
Instead of calling for more waste of national debts on shutting down coal power stations and building windmills or solar farms – I propose that you nail your representatives to instead waste it on building Phillippino storm shelters, at the very least some thousands of lives will be preserved the next time this happens ….
PS (I didn’t really mean that cyclone shelters would be a waste of money – that’s the right thing to spend it on – excuse my editorial discretion to emphasise the waste and misdirection of  funding away from useful pursuits that characterises   the CAGW fantasy)

@bobl, thanks for that info. The other thing that people seem to have missed (you did not) that in a lot of reports the observers focus on storms over the decades but fail to include the population growth and as you said the areas where mainly the poorest people end up. Those areas are always in the low lands , flood plains, tornado alleys etc , and it does not matter what country you look at, from Bangladesh to the Gulf coast in the USA they are the same and have the same vulnerabilities because of that. I have been scratching my head for years why governments keep on keeping people in those locations. those flood plains are great for farming (Nile river, Mississippi River Valley and others all over the world) and making bricks (removing clay to keep the channels open) but must cost fortunes to rebuilt time and again.









David A says: 


					November 14, 2013 at 3:02 am					


They missed three storms just in the Philippines likely as strong, but those pre satellite storms did not have 24 hour, 1oo percent of storm area coverage in THREE DEMENSIONS, measuring of ABOVE GROUND wind speeds?  NO, THOSE PRE SATELITE storms had spotty LAND BASED
 SURFACE LEVEL wind gauges, not likely at the ideal spot, AT THE IDEAL TIME.
 DUH!!!!!!!!!









David A says: 


					November 14, 2013 at 3:10 am					


Historical storms should only be based on surface readings, modified by distance from and relationship to the eye where those readings took place.  In may of the pre-satellite storms the wind gauge broke, and it was not in the ideal location.  In one case in the Philippine’s,  where the wind gauge was not in the ideal location, it broke at 144 MPH, just two less then the land based reading for this storm; which by the way did not break.

@tobias
Mostly it’s historical, before modern transport it was important to found communities around a reliable supply of water and access to a port for shipping, which was originally the best form of freight transport (and probably still is)  Therefore most large cities are built around river mouths.
Many cities are therefore quite flood prone

I supervised a shallow water seismic survey in Bangladesh back in 1974 for UNOCAL (Union Oil of California). On one of the larger islands (Haitia), the chief of the island told me that on a few of the neighboring islands everyone one was killed during the 1970 Bhola Cyclone. Over 500,000 people were killed during that biggy.
Below, I list a few major ones, without the wind speeds (how they estimate the death toll, I would not know) which I got from Wikipedia:
1582, unnamed, 200,000 dead;
The Great Backerganj Cyclone of 1876, 200,000 dead;
1970 Bhola cyclone, where the official death toll was 500,000, but the number is likely to be higher.
1991 Bangladesh cyclone 150,000.
My apologies for getting away from the thread of discussion.









Richard from Oz says: 


					November 15, 2013 at 4:20 pm					


Whatever Mandia’s error may have been, the deception is in the presentation of the graph.  The Y axis shows the storms in order of increasing wind speed, with the latest storm at the top and implying some sort of trend.
If the Y axis was presented in time order (ie earliest at the bottom, latest at the top) there would be no trend over time.
But that wouldn’t present the desired result, would it?

Well, lemme tell you about Wunderground. They “support” Personal Weather Stations”, which is OK, I have one listed there.  you can reference it by zip code (BTW, my station is the ONLY one in this zip code, we are a bit rural). The thing is, they have an “algorithm” which automagically unlists the station if it reports temperatures outside the range of neighboring stations. This is all well and good, unless you take into account the local terrain, which they do not. Here (Vermont) we have ridges which run  N-S, the sun rises E-W, so my station, (at a higher elevation)  will report a temp much higher than the nearest station to the West in the early AM (that station is sighted at a lower elevation and does not get any temp increase until later in the AM , relative to mine). So they conveniently  unlist my station, until the local temp synchs up with the far beyond neighbors later in the AM. So much for micro-climate, just throw it out.
I don’t know, but this doesn’t seem quite correct…
