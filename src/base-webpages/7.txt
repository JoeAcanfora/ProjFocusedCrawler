Typhoon Hagupit began battering the Philippines late Saturday, with strong winds and rain expected to pummel a central belt of the island nation for days as the storm churns westward.
Typhoon Hagupit, whose name means "lash" in Filipino, came ashore on eastern Samar Island just before 10 p.m. with winds of 205 kph  the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane.
Residents of Samar island said they were experiencing strong winds, heavy rain and blackouts on Saturday as Typhoon Hagupit churned towards eastern provinces of the archipelago.
The new storm called Typhoon Hagupit weakened slightly as it moved across the Pacific on Friday and early Saturday, falling below "super typhoon" category.
About half a million people have fled coastal villages and evacuated their homes in the Philippines as a powerful storm approaches the archipelago.
Typhoon Hagupit, which weakened slightly on Friday night, is due to make landfall on Saturday evening. A very dangerous situation is evolving for the Philippines as Typhoon Hagupit, locally known as Ruby, makes landfall in the province of Eastern Samar.
Rain lashed parts of the Philippines on Saturday as Typhoon Hagupit barreled toward the coast, bringing roaring winds and the threat of massive storm surges.
Hagupit, or Ruby in the Philippines, is due to hit land on Saturday evening and is on course for the Eastern and Northern Samar provinces, and the city of Tacloban, where thousands were killed by Typhoon Haiyan a year ago.
