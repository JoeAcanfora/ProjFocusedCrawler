THOUSANDS OF LIVES LOST.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 27.—The typhoon which swept over the Philippine Islands on Oct. 6 was the cause of one of the worst disasters reported from the Southern Ocean In many years- Thousands of lives were lost, among those who perished being many Europeans, and the damage to property was something appalling.
The difficulty of getting news from the Islands is great at any time, and owing to the remoteness of some of the provinces visited by the hurricane full details of the 1st of November. The steamer Gaelic,  from the Orient to-day, brought letters and papers which contain accounts of the ravages of the tidal wave and the winds. Several towns were swept or blown away. Fully 400 Europeans were drowned, and it is estimated that 6,000 natives perished.

They did not have anything to measure wind speeds in those days, and even if they did, they would have conked out before 100 mph.

Original author credibility problem ? 
“The typhoon which swept over the Philippine Islands on Oct. 6 was the cause of one of the worst disasters reported from the Southern Ocean In many years”
Aren’t the Philippines in the northern hemisphere therefore not in the “southern ocean” ?

Typhoons in the Philippine Islands, 1566-1900
 Ricardo García-Herrera*, Pedro Ribera +, Emiliano Hernández * and Luis Gimeno **
 * Dto Física de la Tierra II, Facultad de Ciencias Físicas, Universidad
 Complutense de Madrid, Ciudad Universitaria, 28040 Madrid, Spain
 The original work was made by the Spanish Jesuit, Miguel Selga, at the beginning of the 20th century. The sources, reliability and completeness of the
 chronology are examined critically. A total of 652 events are included, of them 533 are reported as typhoons.Miguel Selga (1879-1956) was a Spanish Jesuit who had studied astronomy at Harvard University and became the last Spanish director of the Manila Observatory during the period 1926-1946 (Udías, 2003).

I guess the New York Times must have made the whole thing up, and your Jesuit friend couldn’t possibly have missed one.
