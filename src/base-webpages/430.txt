More than 2,000 passengers were stuck in ports in Manila and the central Philippines and on the southern island of Mindanao after the coast guard halted sea travel ahead of the Category 5 storm, which could hit areas devastated by Typhoon Haiyan last year. The storm, whose name means “lash” in Filipino, was churning slowly across the Pacific, with the eye of the storm about 310 miles southeast of the Philippines, the local weather bureau said. Its winds were up to 130 miles per hour near the center, with gusts much higher. It was expected to hit Eastern Samar Province in the central Philippines on Saturday, bringing torrential rain and 10- to 14-foot storm surges, the weather bureau said.
