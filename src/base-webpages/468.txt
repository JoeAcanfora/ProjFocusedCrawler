West Pacific Typhoon & Tropical Storm Center



























Watching Low Pressure Near Micronesia


1/8/2015 2:00:00 AM


As of Wednesday evening, EST, there are no active tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific basin. No tropical cyclones are forecast to develop for the next 24 hours.
There is an area of disturbed weather centered a few hundred miles to the south of Pohnpei, Micronesia. This area of low pressure has showed signs of weakening over the past 24 hours with convection becoming more disorganized around an ill-defined low-level center of circulation. The storm system also sits in a marginal location for development as a result of favorable sea surface temperatures, but moderate wind shear. Development of this system remains possible, but is not likely until the end of this week or the weekend.
By AccuWeather.com Meteorologist Steve C. Travis
