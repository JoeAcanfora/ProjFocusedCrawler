JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Tim Tebow is stepping up to help the victims of Typhoon Haiyan.  His foundation has created a donation link on its website to collect funds specifically for the Philippines.

Though Tim Tebow is a Jacksonville native, he was born in the Philippines while his parents served as missionaries.  The Tim Tebow Foundation has also made the Philippines one of the primary beneficiaries of his outreach programs. 

Currently his foundation is working with CURE International to build an orthopedic children's hospital in Davao City.  In addition, it is working with his father's foundation, the Bob Tebow Evangelistic Association, on church planting and orphan care in the Philippines.

The Tim Tebow Foundation said it has a board member on the ground in the Philippines and has received information that the hospital did not sustain damage and the orphans at Uncle Dick's Home are unharmed.

To donate to the Philippines through the Tim Tebow Foundation go to:  

www.timtebowfoundation.org
Mail donations:
Tim Tebow Foundation
2209 County Road 210 W
Suite 108 PMB 329
