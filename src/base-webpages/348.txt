  A monstrous storm has arisen in the Western Pacific, the likes of
  which haven't been seen for several years, meteorologists say.
  The storm, Super Typhoon Haiyan, has become the year's most
  intense and is bearing down on the central Philippines,
  threatening to inflict massive damage and loss of life in the
  area.

    

  The tropical cyclone (the blanket term for  
  hurricanes and typhoons ) packs winds up to 200 mph (320
  km/h), according to estimates from the National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with gusts up to 225 mph (360
  km/h), said Brian McNoldy, a tropical weather expert at the
  University of Miami. This is the equivalent of a very strong
   
  Category 5 hurricane  on the Saffir-Simpson Scale, used to
  rank cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean.


  "It's about as strong as tropical cyclones can get on Earth,"
  McNoldy told LiveScience.  


  Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with Weatherbell Analytics, wrote on
  Twitter that Haiyan has the strongest winds seen since the 1979
  Super Typhoon Tip, the largest and most intense tropical cyclone
  on record. Haiyan's winds make it the strongest storm in the
  satellite era. [ 8
  Terrible Typhoons ]


  Haiyan got so strong because "it has everything working for it,"
  McNoldy said. First, it formed in the open ocean, and thus no
  land mass prevented it from forming a symmetrical circular
  pattern, which helps a cyclone form and gather steam, he said.


  Second, ocean temperatures are incredibly warm, topping out at 86
  degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).  Just as important,
  the warm water also extends deep into the ocean, meaning that
  upwelling caused by the winds will not churn up cold water, which
  dampens cyclone power, McNoldy said. Tropical cyclones are
  basically giant heat engines, powered by the transfer of heat
  from the ocean to the upper atmosphere.


  Third, there is very little wind shear in the area at this time,
  McNoldy said. Wind shear, a difference in wind speed or direction
  with increasing altitude, tears developing hurricanes apart, and
  prevents them from strengthening. Wind shear caused by westerly
  winds is the main reason why the  Atlantic
  hurricane season  featured few strong storms, and got off to a
  late start, weather experts say.

  Haiyan is the 11th typhoon to form in the Western Pacific in the
  last seven weeks, which has been an "exceptionally active
  period," according to the UK Met Office News Blog. It is also the
  year's fifth super typhoon.


  This is somewhat unusual, because the peak of typhoon season
  usually occurs about one month earlier, McNoldy said. Wind shear
  in the area likely prevented that from happening, and now the
  area has become active again due to the weakening of upper-level
  winds and persistent warm surface waters, he added.


  In the Western Pacific, a tropical storm becomes a typhoon when
  its wind speeds reach 74 mph (119 km/h). They  
  become super typhoons  when their winds reach 150 mph (241
  km/h), making them equivalent to strong Category 4 or 5
  hurricanes, according to NOAA.


  Haiyan is likely to push a large storm surge inland — at least 10
  feet (3 meters) — along the eastern coast of the islands of Luzon
  and Samar, according to the Washington Post's Capital Weather
  Gang blog.


  The storm is expected to make landfall near where a  
  deadly magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck  the country less than
  one month ago, killing more than 200 people, according to news
  reports.
