      Emergency relief backgrounder: Typhoon Haiyan

                  Typhoon Haiyan cut an enormous swath of destruction  through the Philippines, affecting more than 9.5 million people.                                      IRC                          



The devastation left by Typhoon Haiyan is a humanitarian catastrophe. The International Rescue Committee is on the ground in the Philippines mobilizing an emergency response. Our emergency team shares this backgrounder on the staggeringly powerful storm and the IRC's plans to help meet survivors' urgent needs: One of the strongest-ever recorded storms to make landfall, with sustained winds of 195 mph and gusts of 230 mph, "super typhoon" Haiyan hit the Philippines on the morning of November 8. The storm initially struck a fishing village in Eastern Samer before traveling across Leyte, Cebu and Visayas islands. Six regions of the country have been affected.Slicing through the center of the 7,107 island archipelago, the typhoon’s path is estimated to have affected more than 9.5 million people. That number is likely to rise as reports continue to trickle in, particularly considering the 28 million people living in the storm’s path. Photos show entire communities washed away, buildings turned to rubble and roads and bridges destroyed. More than 90% of structures in some of the frontline coastal areas have been entirely demolished. While reports and photos so far have been devastating, many of the worst hit areas have yet to be assessed while access remains difficult and communication systems are still down.Limited access to many regions of the country have made calculating death tolls a challenge, but estimates as of Monday morning put the number of casualties at more than 100,000. Nearly a tenth of those have been attributed to Tacloban, the capital of the Philippine province of Leyte, one of the first in the string of locations struck by the storm.The devastation has displaced hundreds of thousands and left many in dire need of food, medical assistance and shelter. The storm has destroyed basic water and sanitation infrastructure, ensuing a significant public health risk. The IRC emergency team first will focus on immediate needs to save lives: health care, clean water and sanitation.Along with homes and infrastructure, people's incomes have also been wiped out by the storm. The IRC is looking at creating cash for work programs to help rebuild in the Philippines in the wake of Haiyan and provide storm survivors with a source of income."It's very easy for people to lose hope in a desperate situation," IRC emergency response director Bob Kitchen said today in an interview with the BBC. "We are here to stop that."Stay Informed: Get Twitter updates from IRC aid workers and others responding to Typhoon Haiyan » Donate Now: Donate now to support families devastated by Typhoon Haiyan »

Dear Debra:We are very grateful for your generosity in offering support for survivors of Typhoon Haiyan.The IRC does not send volunteers to our overseas programs, even in emergencies. However, as you noted, money is desperately needed for this emergency and it is absolutely the best way to help. This video, created by our partners at InterAction, explains why:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzUr86z6pZITo donate to the IRC's emergency response in the Philippines please visit https://www.rescue.org/donate/typhoon-haiyanIf you have further questions, don't hesitate to contact us at donorservices@rescue.org.Many thanks again,All of us at the IRC

    Submitted by judith petree (not verified) on November 12, 2013 - 9:29pm.  

    I made a donation to your organization 2 days ago to aid relief efforts from the typhoon in the Plillipines.  I understand that efforts to deliver essential supplies, clean drinking water, food, shelter have been hampered by destruction of roads and access to areas of need.  Your update states that you hope to have supplies delivered to the people by Friday which may be too late for many of the inhabitants.  I don't understand why supplies wouldn't be able to be dropped from helicopters as I see that the US military has gained access by plane  Every day's delay means that more people will likely sicken and die as a result.  I'm trying to see why there hasn't been a more timely response to this disaster in a more organized manner.  Do the many agencies collecting monies work together to coordinate efforts?  I understand that funds will also be needed in the days ahead but it is disheartening and frustrating to see such suffering in a life and death situation when some relief is needed now.  What exactly are the reasons aid cannot be delivered sooner than 5 days after the event?  Thank you for any updates and answers you may be able to provide to this donor and concerned person.                 Thank you for your efforts already underway.                            Sincerely,  Judith Petree
