Posted Dec. 6, 2014, last updated Dec. 7, 2014Latest Philippines Typhoon update: Torrential levels of rainfall increase risk of “catastrophic” flooding and landslides, International Rescue Committee partners roll out needs assessments across the country (Dec. 7, 4:30pm)CEBU, Philippines – As Typhoon Hagupit (known locally as Ruby) made landfall in the eastern Philippines last night, the International Rescue Committee and our local partners continued preparations to provide emergency relief in the wake of the storm. As many as one million people evacuated as the typhoon approached, with up to 56 million estimated to be at risk. Rainfall volume is the biggest fear, said Greg Matthews, the IRC’s technical advisor in Cebu, where the storm is expected to hit Sunday morning local time. “Ruby is moving slowly, raising concerns about low-lying flooding and landslides in mountainous areas, even for areas outside the typhoon path.”The IRC and our partners are prepared to launch immediate emergency assessments across the country and distribute aid that will include food kits, hygiene kits and tarpaulins — the types of supplies that are already exhausted in some areas.The IRC team in Cebu reported that many residents of island communities have left for the mainland, and that those in other low-lying areas have moved to safer ground. Some are staying with family or in shelters, including daycare centers the IRC built after Typhoon Haiyan one year ago to serve a dual purpose as community storm shelters.“This is a brutal and dangerous storm,” said IRC president and CEO David Miliband. “The IRC is preparing for the absolute worst.” Donate now Give now to support the IRC’s emergency response to Typhoon Hagupit and other disasters and crises in the region.Get typhoon response updatesGet Typhoon Hagupit/Ruby news from IRC aid workers and others on the ground in the Philippines.[<a href="//storify.com/theIRC/typhoon-haiyan-emergency-relief" target="_blank">View the story "Philippines Typhoon #Hagupit #Haiyan - International Rescue Committe" on Storify</a>]
