Typhoon Hagupit




















Typhoon Hagupit has struck the Philippines with formidable force, and locals who still remember Typhoon Haiyan have evacuated in fear.
How you can help:
Donate to the Disaster Ready fund



Typhoon Hagupit slams into Philippines coast Typhoon Hagupit has made landfall in the Philippines, hitting the archipelago with sustained wind speeds of 180km/h and gusts of up to 220km/h.  The formidable storm, also known locally as Ruby, reached Dolores, in Eastern Samar overnight, bringing with it the still-fresh memories of the devastation caused by last year's Typhoon Haiyan in the same area.    Intense to torrential rainfall is falling over Eastern Samar, Samar and Leyte, and is likely to cause flash flooding and potential landslides in mountainous areas. In Tacloban, one of the areas worst hit by Typhoon Haiyan, 100,000 people - or at least half the population - were evacuated to 49 evacuation centres or homes of family and friends. There have been no reported casualties so far in Tacloban. Hagupit is expected to head further west and make landfall five more times as it tracks across the islands to areas including Romblon, Batangas and Zambales over the next two days. Heavy rains and landslides are expected are expected there as well.  READ: A humanitarian's life in the eye of the storm   Staff on the ground World Vision has been operating in the Philippines since 1957 and has decades of experience in responding to large scale disasters in the country. We have highly experienced staff in the affected, and potentially affected, areas.  They have already been working around the clock to prepare for the impact of the typhoon and ensure life-saving aid can be rapidly delivered to those in need as soon as possible.  They are coordinating closely with the UN, government authorities and community leaders to plan response efforts. Supplies ready for distribution  World Vision has pre-positioned emergency supplies for rapid distribution after the typhoon passes, including:    food; shelter kits; water purifiers; hygiene kits; and other essential items for survival  Typhoon Hagupit approaches the Philippines with formidable force.  Picture: NOAA Satellite and Information Service  Preparing communities  World Vision has been helping communities evacuate and prepare for the impact of this potentially
deadly typhoon.  We have been sharing rapid, real-time updates about
evacuation plans and how people can best protect themselves from
Hagupit. Help in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan Typhoon
Hagupit is expected to hit some of the areas impacted by Super Typhoon
Haiyan last year. More than 6,000 people lost their lives and millions
were displaced by Typhoon Haiyan, which is reported to be one of the
strongest typhoons to ever make landfall.  Thanks to the generosity of
our supporters, World Vision has been able to assist more than 1 million
people recover from the impact of this typhoon, including providing
emergency food aid, water and sanitation, shelter, child protection,
education and support to help them restore their livelihoods. Our staff
are now working to try to mitigate the impact of Typhoon Hagupit on
those who had just started rebuilding their lives after Typhoon Haiyan.     ...
