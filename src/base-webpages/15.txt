      Philippines Typhoon: Families take shelter before storm hits Manila    



December 8, 2014 by
    The IRC        


As the International Rescue Committee and our partners in the Philippines continued to respond to the impact of Typhoon Hagupit (known locally as Ruby) on Monday, the still-dangerous tropical storm weakened as it approached the capital Manila. With our partner Philippine Buisiness for Social Progress (PBSP), we delivered emergency food supplies to 1,200 people sheltering in an elementary school just outside the city. The families came from four nearby villages in poor, flood-prone areas. The IRC's Tyler Jump shared these photos:A man secures a tarp over his plywood home just outside Manila as Hagupit pushes toward the city.His village sits on stilts just above a river, and flash floods are a threat even when a typhoon isn't looming.  Nearly everyone from the village evacuated to a nearby storm shelter − a solidly-built elementary school.Roxanne Sacayan, 14, carries a few of her family's belongings to the second-floor classroom where they will sit out the storm. Each of the school's 10 classrooms will be home to several families until the storm subsides. School desks are arranged to create "rooms" for them. Cerlie Librada, 33, and her four children are among hundreds of families at the school receiving emergency food supplies from the IRC and our partner PBSP.The supplies include rice, sardines, canned vegetables, dried fish, oil, sugar, salt and water. Photos: Tyler Jump/IRC
