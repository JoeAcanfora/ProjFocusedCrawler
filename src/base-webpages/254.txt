By Cris Larano and Josephine Cuneta
MANILA — Philippine disaster officials have hoisted the highest warning alert level over a “super typhoon” that could directly hit the central part of the Southeast Asian country on Friday, including areas recently devastated by a massive earthquake.



European Pressphoto Agency
A passenger jeep maneuvers on a flooded road in the town of San Ildefonso, Bulacan province, in the Philippines, on Oct. 12, showing the impact of Typhoon Nari. A new typhoon is on its way to the Philippines.


Glaiza Escullar, a forecaster of the weather bureau Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, said that Haiyan–which will be called Yolanda once it enters Philippine waters early Thursday–is already packing central winds of 150 kilometers per hour. It could strengthen as it hovers above the Pacific Ocean, picking up more moisture and heat that adds to its intensity.Advertisement
“It is expected to make landfall in the Samar-Leyte area around noon Friday and exit the country on Sunday,” said Ms. Esculiar. She said the Haiyan now has a diameter of 600 kilometers and could dump around 30 millimeters of rain an hour near its center, potentially causing floods as well as landslides, particularly in the central province of Bohol that was the worst hit by a 7.2-magnitude earthquake last month.
Government agencies, including local units in areas that potentially will be hit by the Typhoon Haiyan, have been ordered to prepare supplies and equipment, Reynaldo Balido, spokesman for the National Disaster and Risk Reduction Management Council, told The Wall Street Journal. Local officials will decide whether to preemptively evacuate areas in the storm’s path.
The current weather forecast suggest the storm could head to Vietnam after passing through the Philippines.
The Hawaii-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center is calling Haiyan a “super typhoon,” estimating the weather disturbance’s maximum sustained winds at 130 knots–around 241 kilometers per hour–or the equivalent of a strong Category 4 storm. The Hawaii warning center’s 36-hour forecast suggests that Haiyan’s center winds around 267 kilometers per hour, with gusts of 324 kilometers an hour.
The Japan Meteorological Agency is classifying Haiyan’s intensity when it makes landfall Friday as “violent.” Center winds of around 195 kilometers per hour are predicted, and gusts of around 278 kilometers an hour.
Ms. Escullar said typhoons that form around this time of the year usually make landfall in the Philippines because of the Siberian High, the prevailing high pressure system over Asia during the winter months. Unlike the Hawaii-based typhoon center, the Philippine bureau doesn’t use a super typhoon label. Instead, it categorizes a typhoon with winds of over 185 kilometers an hour under signal 4, the strongest public storm warning in the Philippines, Ms. Escullar said.
If it maintains its strength, Haiyan will be the second super typhoon to make landfall this year. Super Typhoon Usagi made landfall in the northern part of the Philippines in September.
Weather forecasters said Haiyan could be stronger than Typhoon Bopha, whose center winds of 175 kilometers per hour devastated a large part of the southern region of Mindanao last December, killing more than 300 people. In December 2011, flash floods unleashed by Tropical Storm Washi killed more than 1,200 people, also in Mindanao.
Rey Gozon, the Philippine disaster council’s director for Region 8, which includes the provinces of Samar and Leyte, said the regional council met Tuesday to prepare for Haiyan and emergency teams are ready for deployment. He said the disaster council will secure reports late Wednesday on whether pre-emptive evacuations are being undertaken to avoid casualties.
