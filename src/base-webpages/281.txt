Hagupit, or Ruby in the Philippines, is due to hit land on Saturday evening and is on course for the Eastern and Northern Samar provinces, and the city of Tacloban, where thousands were killed by Typhoon Haiyan a year ago.
Typhoon Hagupit was packing wind gusts in excess of 200 km/h when it made landfall in Dolores, Eastern Samar, early on Sunday.
Residents of Samar island said they were experiencing strong winds, heavy rain and blackouts on Saturday as Typhoon Hagupit churned towards eastern provinces of the archipelago.
Rain lashed parts of the Philippines on Saturday as Typhoon Hagupit barreled toward the coast, bringing roaring winds and the threat of massive storm surges.
Typhoon Hagupit began to lash the eastern Philippines with ferocious winds and heavy rain Saturday, knocking down trees and causing power outages as an estimated 1 million coastal residents fled to safety.
Typhoon Hagupit weakened to a category three storm, two levels below a super typhoon, but could still unleash huge destruction with torrential rain and potentially disastrous storm surges of up to 4.5 metres, the weather bureau  said.
A very dangerous situation is evolving for the Philippines as Typhoon Hagupit, locally known as Ruby, makes landfall in the province of Eastern Samar.
