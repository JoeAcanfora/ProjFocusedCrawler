			The Yolanda Anniversary Music Video (We Will Rise Again) 		



		Details		



					Hits: 735				

 


A year after Typhoon Yolanda struck the Philippines, the  government will pay tribute to the Filipino resilience and spirit, honor our fellow Filipinos affected by the calamity, and recognize the people and organizations who have selflessly provided assistance in the Yolanda Rehabilitation and Recovery efforts through a series of activities along the Yolanda corridor.  
One of the main activities in the one-year anniversary is a simultaneous launch of the “We Will Rise Again” music video, online and in various television stations and cinemas all over the country on 06 November 2014 at exactly 11:30 AM. All government agencies, television networks, cinemas, development partners, and private sector partners will likewise share the link of the music video in their official websites and other social media platforms.
This music video highlights the Filipino Bayanihan and showcases the efforts in the relief, recovery and rehabilitation phases in the affected areas a year after. It also serves as a reminder that regardless of the magnitude of the devastation, the Filipinos will strive hard to rebuild their communities and ensure that all the assistance extended by our partners will not go to waste. 
Thus, the Office of the Presidential Assistant for Rehabilitation and Recovery (OPARR) has put together this “We Will Rise Again” music video as a reminder of the unwavering determination, the indomitable spirit, and the unparalleled resilience of the Filipinos. In producing the video, government agencies, local government units, development partners, civil society organizations, private sector partners, and survivors alike shared photos and video footages from Typhoon Yolanda. The performer, Ms. Raki Vega, and composer, Mr. Jude Gitamondoc, both Cebuanos when they heard about this project, graciously shared their performance and talent to make this video possible. 
We encourage every Filipino to share this music video as a message of thanks to everyone who helped.. 
A year after Typhoon Yolanda struck the Philippines, as a nation, as a people – this is our hope, our prayer, and our promise… We Will Rise Again.
