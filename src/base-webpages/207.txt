The biggest truck on Earth

On New Year’s Day, AFP photographer Dominique Faget joined France’s defence minister on a lightening visit to an army base in Niger's remote north. "The desert outpost lies at the gates of Libya, right on the route used by jihadists and arms smugglers to reach northern Mali and Niger from the violence-wracked state," he writes. "Near the gleaming new runway, I spot five or six trucks piled high with a mind-boggling load – at a standstill under the sun. I slip away from the group visit for a moment to investigate, and snap a few pictures."

Above the fold

Back among the living

Behind the image


To mark the end of 2014, every day until New Year's Eve an AFP photographer gives the back story to an image of beauty or hope, taken in times of crisis, war and upheaval.
“These two faces tell the story of Turkey’s deadliest ever industrial disaster,” writes Bulent Kilic, who captured this embrace between a father and his son, rescued from a horrific death after a mine blast left hundreds trapped underground.

The slap of forgiveness
Tuesday 30 December 2014 -  
		    
Behind the image


Iranian photographer Arash Khamooshi captured the moment a mother spared the life of her son's killer. "At 6:20 am Balal was led out in handcuffs by prison guards. He was wearing a blindfold and they put the noose around his neck," he writes. "He cried out for forgiveness but the mother, who under 'qisas' -- the sharia law of retribution -- has the right to kick away the chair on which the condemned man stands, said she was not willing to forgive."

At the beach in Gaza
Monday 29 December 2014 -  
		    
Behind the image


Mahmud Hams spent the summer photographing the last war in Gaza. "Fifty days of shots of children crushed in the rubble. Parents weeping beside lifeless little bodies. Death. Destruction. Funerals of men, women, children, sometimes very young children," he writes. "And suddenly, on the same beach where an Israeli missile killed four children playing football, I see an image of pure joy: a happy father throwing his laughing baby up into the air. Ten days after the end of the war, I understand that it is over."

Happy homecoming

Behind the image


"This has been a tragic year for journalists," writes Kenzo Tribouillard. "But there were also moments of great joy and relief for the profession, and I was lucky enough to witness one of them. On April 20 at dawn, I headed to the Villacoublay military airport outside Paris to cover the homecoming of four French journalists, held captive in Syria for months."

Stroll through the ruins

Behind the image


"This was a crowded market before the Syria uprising. It’s one of the worst-damaged streets in Douma, the rebel bastion in the suburbs of Damascus that has been under government siege for more than a year now," writes Abd Doumany. "People are certainly not safe to venture outside, but they have to."

Joy amid the bloodshed
Friday 26 December 2014 -  
		    
Behind the image


To mark the end of 2014, every day until New Year's Eve an AFP photographer tells the story of an image of beauty or hope, taken in times of crisis, war and upheaval.
When he travelled to the strife-torn Central African Republic in February, Issouf Sanogo witnessed an extraordinary scene after a visit by President Samba Panza. "As her car revs up to leave, dozens of women and children start running behind it, jumping with joy, laughing and yelling," he writes. "That brief explosion of joy, captured on camera, is such a relief, so different from the atrocities I have been photographing."

Daring democracy
Thursday 25 December 2014 -  
		    
Behind the image


"Among the crowd hanging out around midday at the pro-democracy protest camp in early October in Hong Kong's Admiralty district was a young woman with the word 'democracy' written on her leg," writes AFP photojournalist Alex Ogle. "There were a bunch of (male) photographers around taking her photo and I walked past not particularly interested in joining the pack to get a shot, only to double back a second later to get a picture. A young woman sitting there with a political statement on her body seemed pretty bold for such a demure crowd."

A smile in a cemetery
Wednesday 24 December 2014 -  
		    
Behind the image


"I took this picture on July 1 in the port of Pozzallo at the southern tip of Sicily. It shows migrant families waiting to disembark from an Italian navy ship after being rescued in the Strait of Sicily," writes Giovanni Isolino. "Covering migrant landings and shipwrecks, sometimes you see children arriving alone. And even when they have their families, they are usually upset, and frightened. Seeing a child smile like this is something very rare, and special."
