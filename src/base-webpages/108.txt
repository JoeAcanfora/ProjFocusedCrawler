Strongest Cyclone of 2013 Slams Philippines

		Relief efforts are being mobilized in the United States to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful storms to ever batter the Philippines. The storm slammed into the central Philippines on Friday, perhaps causing scores of deaths [according to preliminary estimations] and widespread damage. Government and non-government organizations in the U.S. are reaching out to help those affected.

Rain battered Cebu Island as Typhoon Haiyan roared ashore. As it moved inland, it left behind shattered homes and washed-out roads.

The storm is known in the Philippines as Yolanda. It left many communities with no power and no communications.

As a result, Jose Cuisia, Jr., the Philippines ambassador to the United States, said the full extent of damage is not yet known.

"It is too early to tell what exactly we will need, but definitely after the relief operations there is going to be a lot of work in terms of reconstruction and rehabilitation, particularly for people who have lost their homes," he said.

Cuisia said he is appealing to Philippine-American community to help those affected.

He also said the U.S.State Department has offered to provide assistance, and the U.S. military has offered to provide aircraft and experienced personnel.

The ambassador said in previous storms, diseases spread by standing water have been a big problem. He said private organizations have donated medicine to help with these ailments.

"We have to make sure that particularly in places where there are floods the people avoid being contaminated by these contaminated waters, and making sure that we have all of the proper medications for these people should they be exposed to these contaminated waters," he said.

The National Federation of Filipino American Associations is holding a series of community events to raise money for victims, including a concert in Alexandria, Virginia, near Washington.

Communications Director Jon Melegrito said many of the group's members have been trying to reach relatives in the affected regions. “There is a tremendous amount of concern about the damage and the dislocation and the broken lives and the deaths. So, we are constantly in a state of vigil, just monitoring what is happening.”

Melegrito said the Philippines is facing a long-term recovery effort but hopes his group's donations will provide some immediate relief. “We hope that we can rise to the level where our generosity will at least come close to alleviating some of the suffering that they are going through right now.”

Meanwhile, storm preparations are underway in Vietnam, which soon could feel Typhoon Haiyan wrath [expected landfall around 1800 UTC on Saturday].

The Vietnamese Embassy in Washington says the government has begun storm preparations, which include evacuation plans and fortifying dikes and dams.

Longer term there will be good opportunities for you to pay your own way to the Phillippines as a volunteer.

 Political Wrangling Heats Up Over Keystone Pipeline


                        Top officials with the U.S. oil industry are urging Congress and the president to approve a controversial oil pipeline that would bring crude from Canada to refineries on the U.S. Gulf coast.

                        The worst Ebola outbreak in history is in its second year, and scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine against the virus.  Since December of 2013, when the Ebola outbreak began in West Africa, the World Health Organization reports more than 20,000 people have been infected with the virus, and of those, more than 8,000 people have died.

 US Defends Cuba Policy in Wake of Dissident Arrests


                        Cuban dissidents say last week’s detention of activists by Cuban authorities demonstrates what they call the fallacy of U.S. President Barack Obama’s recent decision to re-establish diplomatic relations with the communist nation and relax some restrictions on travel and trade.  As VOA’s Bill Rodgers reports, the Obama administration maintains its new policy eventually will help bring change to Cuba.

 Simple New Test Detects Early Signs of Diabetes


                        People with Type 1 diabetes, usually diagnosed in children and young adults, must take insulin injections and watch their diet to keep their blood sugar levels balanced. Diagnosing the disease usually requires taking blood samples, a frightening experience for many youngsters. Researchers in the United Kingdom say they have developed a simple, non-invasive initial test, which requires only a whiff of the patient’s breath. VOA’s George Putic reports.

                        Cambodia’s final exam results for 2014 were disastrous, with more than half of the 90,000 students failing. The reason? The authorities stamped out cheating - the first of a series of reforms designed to fix the impoverished country’s broken education sector. Robert Carmichael reports for VOA from Phnom Penh.
