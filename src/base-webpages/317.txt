                            Bye bye, byes; Rest should serve favorites well
                        






        Posted: January 07, 2015 - 1:00 am
    





If this past weekend’s Wild Card games taught us anything, it was that rest can be the most welcome of gifts for a banged up NFL squad. In three of the games, key contributors were unable to play due to injury. The Arizona Cardinals were completely inept offensively with essentially their fourth quarterback, Ryan Lindley, under center. The Pittsburgh Steelers couldn’t gain the balanced offense they had showcased all season without star running back LeVeon Bell, who got hurt in Week 17. The Cincinnati Bengals weren’t able to get quarterback Andy Dalton his first career playoff win, but he didn’t have all-world wide receiver A.J. Green or starting tight end Jermaine Gresham.

When I was a little girl, there were times when my brother and I would get into laughing wrestling matches. He was only 360 days my junior, and we were pretty even. Mom would holler out from somewhere, “Big laugh, big cry!” The weirdest thing was that she was right about 80 percent of the time. I paid attention.
