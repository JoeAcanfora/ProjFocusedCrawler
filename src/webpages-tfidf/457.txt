The search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has widened far beyond the place where she was  last seen. 
The Albemarle County Sheriff's Office and a group of volunteers were searching along Avon Street and throughout Friendship Court Tuesday night. That is more than a mile from McGrady's Irish Pub, where Hannah was last seen on surveillance footage late Friday night.
Andy Lawson volunteers with Albemarle Search and Rescue. 
"Any sign," he said. "That's all we can do."
Lawson searched dumpsters, bushes and even the community garden at Friendship Court Tuesday night. He has not found anything that warrants investigation.
"There are tons of areas that are very thickly covered in brush and foliage," said Guy Williams, with the Albemarle Sheriff's Office. "Garden areas, ditches, drainage areas. So we're just trying to rule that out."
Tim Payne is another volunteer who is helping with the effort. 
"Without a shadow of a doubt these folks are very dedicated to it," Williams said. "They've spent countless hours training. It's just a community coming together to find this young lady."
A search helicopter was also being used Tuesday night, circling around the Preston Avenue area, and above the searchers at Friendship Court. Bloodhounds were also brought out, for the third night in a row. 
The search crews will continue to widen the search area Wednesday morning.
