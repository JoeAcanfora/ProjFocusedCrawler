 Nightmare: They thanked the thousands of strangers, friends and relatives that have supported them so far  
 Family: They explained how Hannah's disappearance has affected their son James (pictured) and othersA $100,000 reward has been offered by the University of Virginia and the city of Charlottesville, Hannah's hometown, for information that leads to the university student's return.Police have received thousands of tips, Mrs Graham informed reporters, expressing thanks from the family.She added: 'We would also like to thank the many, many kind people who have supported our family during this terrible ordeal through words, deeds, thoughts and prayers.'Matthew has been charged with abduction with intent to defile 18-year-old Hannah Graham, who disappeared after a night out with friends. He has also been linked to the murder of Alexis Murphy, 17, who was last seen in Nelson County, Virginia, on August 3, 2013. He has not been charged in the case, for which another man was found guilty.   
 Charged: Jesse 'LJ' Matthews has been charged with abduction and attempt to defile Hannah Graham 
 
Linked: Matthews has now been linked to the murders of Morgan Harrington (left) and Alexis Murphy (right)Matthew was scheduled to appear in court Thursday on the abduction charge and reckless driving charges after authorities said he sped away from a police station Sept. 20. The cases were postponed until December.Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the disappearance of the 19-year-old University of Virginia student.The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with Graham the night she went missing from downtown Charlottesville.Now investigators are looking into Matthew's movements over the last 12 years, focusing in on the more than six months he attended Christopher Newport University when two other young women disappeared without a trace.  
 Search: The University of Virginia and City of Charlottesville have offered a $100 reward for information  
 No trace: Search teams have been patrolling the area for more than three weeks, even using dronesMatthew transferred to the Newport News school after being kicked out of Liberty University in Lynchburg in 2002 following allegations of rape.He attended CNU from January 2003 before dropping out the following October. During that time, two local women went missing and were never found again.Autumn Wind Day, 24, was last seen shopping at the Food Lion grocery store two miles from campus when she disappeared on July 24, 2003.Less than two months later, 31-year-old Sophie May Rivera went missing after leaving her home located seven miles from CNU. Matthew left the CNU football team five days after Rivera vanished, and dropped out of school a month later. Local police are now reopening the two cold cases to see if Matthew may have been involved.
