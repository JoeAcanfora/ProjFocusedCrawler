Virginia police are continuing the search for a college student who disappeared after leaving a party early Saturday morning, WTKR reported.
Hannah Elizabeth Graham, a sophomore at the University of Virginia, was last seen at an off-campus party at a Charlottesville apartment complex around midnight Friday.

The 18-year-old left the party alone and sent her friends a text message at around 1:20 a.m. Saturday saying she was lost, according to the station. Her friends reported her missing Sunday when she did not come home.
On Tuesday, Charlottesville police told Fox News they were using bloodhounds to search the area east of the university and are following leads. About 50 law enforcement officers have been assigned to the case. 
Police released pictures of Graham in her apartment building Friday night a few hours before she went missing. The 5-foot-11-inch blue-eyed teen is seen wearing a crop top with dark-colored pants.
Those who know Graham describe her as a level-headed, responsible girl.
"Hanna is not the kind of kid that would just go on a road trip and disappear," Stephen Rice, a band director at her former high school, told NBC Washington. "She was always very diligent with everything she did, and always did everything exactly by the book."
The Charlottesville apartments are in an area the North Virginia native is not familiar with, police told WTKR. 
"I think it's real tragic when anything like this happens," Brannon Johnson, a senior at the university, told The Charlottesville Newsplex. "It definitely questions everything in terms of safety and how everyone is going to react and move around grounds for sure."
