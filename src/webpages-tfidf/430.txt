GERMANTOWN, Md. (AP/WJLA) — A Clarksburg woman told investigators Saturday that her two children, who have been missing for about a week, are alive and safe, but she didn't tell authorities where they were.

At a Saturday evening news conference, Montgomery County police said they had searched 16 locations, mostly in Clarksburg, looking for the children.
Sunday, police searched eight areas in or near Darnestown for 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle.
Authorities located the mother, 27-year-old Catherine Hoggle, late Friday night walking in the area of Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive in Germantown.
When officers spotted her, she attempted to flee. But Hoggle was taken into custody and has been booked on a charge of misdemeanor child neglect; an appearance before a magistrate judge was pending.
Hoggle left her common-law husband, Troy Turner, last Monday after she was unclear about where she had dropped off her children, authorities said. Turner called the police on Monday around 8 p.m. to report all three missing.
“I don't believe she'd just leave them somewhere,” Turner said. “And I don't believe she would harm them.”
Hoggle has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, authorities said, and was continuing to be questioned by detectives. Family members said she had recently gone off her medication.
Police said they believe Hoggle had been living on the street since her disappearance and had altered her appearance since she was last seen. Her hair had been cut, but she was wearing the same clothing, investigators noted.
Although Hoggle told authorities that "the kids are safe," she didn’t say where they might be. Police were working to verify the statement and have enlisted K-9 units to join the search for the missing children.
“We can't say why she has not been forthcoming, but she has not,” said Lt. Sonia Pruitt of the Montgomery Co. Police.
“I believe she thought she was protecting the kids when she took them,” Turner said.
