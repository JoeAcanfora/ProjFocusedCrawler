	Police believe they have found the remains of a North Carolina college student 11 days after she first disappeared.

Boone police tweeted Saturday they believe a body found Saturday morning near Appalachian State University is Anna Smith.

	Authorities said her driver's license and school ID were found near the body in the wooded area.

	Police said the 18-year-old freshman history major from High Point was in personal crisis and was "anguished" when she was last seen taking a van to a school dorm the night of Sept. 2, reports the Charlotte Observer. She did not live at the dorm where she was last seen, the newspaper reported.  We had hoped so much that this search would end differently. 

Appalachian State Chancellor Sheri N. Everts issued a statement to the university community encouraging everyone to seek support from one another.

	"Having one of our own missing struck the Appalachian community very hard, and this very sad news is heartbreaking for us all," she wrote. "The loss of Anna will continue to weigh heavy on our hearts. I ask that we all join together to support and care for one another as we mourn."

	During the 11 days she was missing there were several members of the university's student body, faculty and staff that helped with the search, she said.

	"We had hoped so much that this search would end differently, yet all of these efforts underscore our belief in just how integral each of us is to this community,” she wrote.

	"It is important for each of us to remember that we are not alone. There are always people in this Appalachian community to whom we can turn for solace, caring counsel, and assistance. I find strength in the great power of our community to support those with broken hearts and burdened spirits who have been powerfully affected by the loss of this bright young light," she wrote.
