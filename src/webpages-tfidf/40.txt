CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA (WWBT) -
            Charlottesville Police are now telling us the name of a man being called a person of interest in the disappearance of 18 year old Hannah Graham. 
They say his name is Jesse Matthew. Officials tell us they searched the man's home at the Hessian Hills apartments on Friday, and they also seized the car he was driving. 
Graham went missing a week ago. They believe the missing UVA student went inside the Tempo Restaurant and Bar in the Downtown Mall with the person of interest. Police say he purchased alcohol and within 15 minutes they were gone. Both were seen in surveillance video. Officers believe Graham left with him in his burnt orange 1998 Chrysler coupe.
It's unclear whether investigators have questioned Matthew yet. Police say they are still aware of his location. Call the Charlottesville Police tip line at (434) 295-3851 if you have information about this case.
