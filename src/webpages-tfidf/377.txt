Hannah Graham’s parents: Someone can ‘End this nightmare’

Charlottesville, Va. – The parents of UVa. student Hannah Graham released an emotional video on Saturday pleading for help bringing their missing daughter home.
The 18-year-old was last seen exactly three weeks ago in the early hours of Saturday, Sept 13 on Charlottesville’s Downtown Mall.
“Somebody listening to me today either knows where Hannah is or knows someone who has that information,” Sue Graham said fighting back tears. “We appeal to you to come forward and tell us where Hannah can be found.”
John Graham was beside his wife’s side as she delivered a powerful statement.
“John has already said that this is every parent’s worst nightmare. That is true. But it is also nightmare for our son, James, for Hannah’s grandparents, and other members of our family as well for Hannah’s many friends here in Charlottesville and beyond.”
Graham also said that despite an individual has been charged in Hannah’s abduction, and the massive search efforts, no trace of Hannah has been found.
“Help end this nightmare for all of us. Please help us to bring Hannah home,” Sue Graham begged as her husband took his wife in his arms.
The couple again thanked the entire community as well as those who have worked so hard to find their daughter.
“We would like to again express our enormous gratitude to all those who have been involved in the search for Hannah,” Sue Graham said. “The police, the professional search teams, the people staffing the telephone tip line, UVa. students, our friends, neighbors and work colleagues — as well as the citizens of Charlottesville and the surrounding area.
The couple also thanked Charlottesville, the university and public who have contributed to the reward fund, which has grown to $100,000.
“We have been overwhelmed by the generosity of you all,” Sue Graham said fighting back tears.
Anyone with information about Graham’s whereabouts is asked to call a special tip line at 434-295-3851. 
The Search for Hannah Continues
As Virginia State Police resumed the search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham Friday, the Virginia Department of Emergency Management had a special message for people headed into the weekend.
“I know there is a lot of hiking and outdoors activity with hunters and so forth,” VDEM search and rescue coordinator Mark Eggeman said. “We ask them to look at those trails. As they go out, keep their eyes open.  Tell us if you see something out of the ordinary.”
A 40-person team searched the woods of Albemarle County on Friday for Hannah. The search effort would ramp up over the weekend, Eggeman said. In addition to more searchers on the ground, VDEM expected to use canines and all-terrain vehicles.
“We’re going to focus on those areas towards the north where we continue to follow-up on investigative leads,” he said. “We’re going to try and cover an eight-mile radius.”
Cloud cover prevented an air search for Hannah on Friday.

Simply heartbreaking.
I fear her body could be anywhere between Charlottesville, VA  and Galveston, Texas.
