SOUTH JORDAN, Utah – Police have arrested a man who they said brandished a weapon at store employees and was considered armed and dangerous.
Sam Winkler of the South Jordan Police Department said 37-year-old Dennis Monard was arrested Wednesday evening in West Valley City.
Officials said earlier in the week Monard is accused of pulling a gun on Walmart employees.
Authorities said they were called to the South Jordan Walmart near 113th S. and Jordan Gateway at about 8 p.m. Monday night.
Police said store security tried to stop a man they thought might have been shoplifting.
Officials said he pulled out a gun when security approached him.
He then got into a truck and drove away.
Officers said they found the truck about a mile away in a neighborhood but the suspect was not there.
Police said witnesses in the neighborhood told them the suspect may have stolen a bike.
They said he rode down the Jordan River Parkway Trail.
