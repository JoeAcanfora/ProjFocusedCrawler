Crews search along Route 29, rural properties for missing UVa. student Hannah Graham

Charlottesville, Va. – More than two weeks after Hannah Graham vanished without a trace, there is still no sign of the missing University of Virginia student.
Hopes remain high on campus as specialized crews from the Virginia Department of Emergency Management search areas throughout Central Virginia, including rural parts of Albemarle County, according to a report from WTVR in Richmond, Va.
Professional investigative search crews canvassed areas on Route 29 in southern Albemarle County on Sunday. Crews using search dogs and ATVs to reach remote areas searching for any clues, including possibly any torn clothing as well as for misplaced tire tracks or abandoned sheds.
And of course, officials want people who saw Jesse Matthew, the man arrested on abduction with the intent to defile, the weekend Graham disappeared to come forward.
Even though Graham has been missing for over two weeks, authorities do not want the public to think the search operation is being reduced in any way, the report says.
“The operation is not being scaled back. We have a number of people who are out searching all day long and have been throughout the entire weekend. We have people here who are mapping the areas that have been searched. We’re doing systematic searches of rural property and land,” Carter Johnson with the Albemarle County Police Department said.
However, the billboards in the Richmond area that were asking people for information regarding Graham were no longer active as of Sunday.
If you have information that could help investigators, call Charlottesville Police at 434-295-3851.
Graham was officially reported missing on Sept. 14, though she was last seen in the early hours of Sept. 13.

As the brother of yet another unsolved murder in Virginia– my sister Cathy died as part of the Colonial Parkway Murders near Williamsburg from 1986-1989– I am thrilled to see law enforcement taking another look at the unsolved murders and disappearances of so many young people.  There is clearly a pattern of unsolved murders and disappearances in Virginia from Hannah Graham all the way back to the Colonial Parkway Murders. I call upon the FBI, Virginia State Police, county and local law enforcement to continue to share resources and solve these horrible crimes , including Hannah Graham’s disappearance.
