The killer who took the life of a Virginia Tech student in 2009 is still out there, but a revised sketch of the suspect could help close the case. The FBI just released a new image of the man wanted in the murder of Morgan Harrington. News4's Julie Carey has the latest.

The FBI has revised its sketch of a man linked to the slaying of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington.
Media outlets report that the Help Save the Next Girl campaign posted the new sketch Sunday on its Facebook page. Harrington's parents and two media and advertising companies started the campaign last fall.
The composite sketch is similar to one that the FBI released in 2005 following a sexual assault in Fairfax County. The FBI says the man has been forensically linked to both cases.
Harrington's mother, Gil Harrington, says the new sketch is more realistic.
“It just is so much more recognizable than the artist’s rendering from 2005, and I really think it increases the likelihood someone will see him and recognize him and call in a tip,” she said.
Soon billboards bearing the new composite sketch will go up, News4's Julie Carey reported, a technique that produced a tip that led to the arrest of a suspect in the East Coast Rapist case.
The FBI reminds that the man may have altered his appearance.
Harrington was last seen in October 2009 after leaving a Metallica show in Charlottesville. Her remains were found in January 2010 in a hayfield in Albemarle County.
Harrington's family is offering a $100,000 reward and Metallica is offering a $50,000 reward.
