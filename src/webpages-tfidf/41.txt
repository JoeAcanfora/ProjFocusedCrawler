CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (WRIC) -
            Hannah has been missing for over a week.The suspect of her abduction, Jesse Leroy Matthew, Jr., was arrested in Galveston, Texas Wednesday afternoon in connection with her disappearance. After Hannah was spotted near Tempo Restaurant, the establishment has released a statement saying that Hannah was "not seen inside the restaurant and was never served."The full statement from Brice Cunninghamm, owner of Tempo Restaurant, reads: "The Tempo Restaurant family joins the entire Charlottesville community as it continues its search to find Hannah Graham and return her to her family. As longtime members of this unique city, we share the resolve to ensure that Charlottesville remains a safe and special place, and will continue to do absolutely everything we can possibly do to help uncover any facts that will bring Hannah home.On Wednesday, September 17, when the Charlottesville Police Department first released video that showed Hannah walking along the downtown mall at around 1 am, Tempo was able to immediately provide authorities with information that pinpointed the location of the Person of Interest, Mr. Matthew. Details of credit card receipts showed that he had made purchases at the bar shortly after midnight while Hannah was still making her way towards the downtown mall from Preston Avenue. Those records also confirm that he returned to Tempo at 1:10 am and left shortly after, although Ms. Graham was not seen inside the restaurant and was never served. She was, however, noticed by the door-person outside the restaurant at that time, and seen leaving with Matthew shortly thereafter. These details helped police reconstruct Ms. Graham's movements and last known whereabouts.Tempo will continue to assist and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the ongoing investigation, and we urge anyone that might have information about these events, no matter how inconsequential it may seem, to please call the tip line at 434- 295-3851. Our focus remains on finding Hannah and returning her to her family, and neither the Tempo staff nor our friends and neighbors in this community will rest until that goal has been achieved."Matthew was arrested on a beach in the Texas community of Gilchrist by Galveston County Sheriff's authorities, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo announced Wednesday night. Police say that he will be extradited back to the Commonwealth.The capture came less than a full day after police announced they had probable cause to arrest Matthew on charges of abduction with intent to defile Hannah Graham, an 18-year-old sophomore who went missing on Sept. 13 in Charlottesville.Longo said an intense search for Graham continues."This case is nowhere near over," he told a news conference late Wednesday. "We have a person in custody but there's a long road ahead of us and that long road includes finding Hannah Graham."Stay with 8News for continued updates on this case and the search for Hannah.
