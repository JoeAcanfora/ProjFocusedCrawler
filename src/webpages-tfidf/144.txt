The pub is about a 14-minute walk from the spot were Graham sent a text to friends to tell them she was lost, according to CBS 6 reporter Melissa Hipolit. That text was sent at about 1:20 a.m. Saturday. That was the last time anyone heard from the second-year student from Northern Virginia. Police said Graham was “fairly well intoxicated” at the time she was last seen.
The timeline for the last moments which Hannah was spotted are as follows:
11: 50 p.m. Friday she was last seen by friends at Camden Plaza Apartments, in the 200 block of 14th Street NW.
12:45 a.m. Saturday she was seen on surveillance video outside of McGrady’s Pub on Grady Street.
1:20 a.m. she sends a text to friends saying she was lost in the area around 14th and Wertland Streets.
Although, now police believe that final text was not sent from the place where she said she was. 

“Those of us who know and love Hannah know that she would not disappear without contacting family or friends. She is highly responsible and organized,” her family said in a statement released through the University Tuesday.
“We express our sincere gratitude to law enforcement and everyone who is involved in the search for Hannah. We also thank the University for the full attention they are devoting to the situation. The kindness and support of so many – her friends at U.Va., particularly her friends on the Ski Team, her friends from high school, our neighbors, and the larger community – mean so much to us at this difficult time.”

The search for Graham continued Tuesday as police and volunteers searched around Preston Avenue in Albemarle County. A tip to police indicated Graham may have been seen in that area.
