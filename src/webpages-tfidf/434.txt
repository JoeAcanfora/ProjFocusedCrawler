(AP)    September 29    Related story: Police say suspect’s arrest provides lead in Harrington’s death    Related: Timeline: The case of Morgan Harrington    The following is the text of a statement released Monday by Virginia State Police involving the death of Morgan Harrington:   For the past five years, the Virginia State Police has been aggressively pursuing the investigation into the disappearance and death of 20-year-old Morgan D. Harrington of Roanoke, Va. Last week, the arrest of Jesse L.

Meanwhile, state police continues to dedicate the necessary resources to assist the Charlottesville Police Department through the course of its investigation and with their efforts to locate Hannah Graham. In fact, right now, the public’s focus needs to remain on helping Charlottesville Police locate and bring Hannah Graham home. We will have no further comment nor will we be doing any on-camera interviews concerning our ongoing investigation.          Share on FacebookShare   Share on TwitterTweet       SECTION: {section=local, subsection=null}!!!
