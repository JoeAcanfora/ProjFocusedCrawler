CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. – Police have issued a wanted poster and released the photo of Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr.
Matthew, 32, is wanted for misdemeanor reckless driving, however, Charlottesville Police have called him a Person of Interest in the disappearance of 18-year-old University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, according to a report from WTVR.
“I believe Jesse Matthew was the last person she was seen with before she vanished off the face of the earth,” Charlottesville Police Tim Longo said during a Sunday news conference. “It’s been a week and we can’t find her. It’s been a week and someone has got to know something.”
Longo said Matthew walked into the police station Saturday and asked for a lawyer. After Matthew spoke with a lawyer, Longo said he left the station, got into a vehicle with another person and drove off, the report says.
“State and federal authorities who were overtly monitoring his movement saw him get into a car and leave a location to Albemarle County at a high rate of speed, driving in a matter that was reckless and placed others in danger,” Chief Longo said.
Longo said he would not speculate on why Matthew sped off, but said investigators are “aggressively pursuing his location.”
“Matthew has associates/contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington D.C., ” the wanted poster indicated. “If you have information as to his whereabouts please call the Charlottesville Police Department or the 24-hour tip line at 434-295-3851.”

That dude really looks like the sketch of the Morgan Harrington case from 2009.  They never found her killer.  Check this out.  http://a.abcnews.com/images/US/ht_Morgan_Harrington_suspect_nt_120604_wmain.jpg

can u say serial killer. aren’t 4/5 other girls also missing in last five years in that area. just more black-on-white crime and the numbers don’t lie. go take a look the yearly FBI statistics. really makes me sick. straight to the gallows if proven guilty.

two out of the five missing girls are young black women. so no its not black on white crime. its a a string of YOUNG women being abducted, based mostly on how YOUNG they are.

Why don’t they trace her cell phone? Even if it is off there should be some way to trace it. Maybe if they trace it might lead them to her. Even if its by GPS FBI can do anything thing.
