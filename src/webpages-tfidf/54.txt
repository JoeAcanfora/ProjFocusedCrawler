  Approach: The footage released by Charlottesville police shows Hannah (bottom left) walking by the doors of McGrady's Irish pub at around 12.46am on Saturday 
  Eerie: At today's press conference, Charlottesville police released footage of the eerie Shell station forecourt that Hannah Graham ran past just before 1am on Saturday morningCharlottesville's Chief of Police Timothy Longo said he did not believe she was being chased as the second film shows her stop running and walking.He was also pained to point out that no one should judge the student just because she appeared to be intoxicated and that the most important thing now is to find her.However Hannah's parents have revealed they now fear the worst.In a statement released through the police John and Susan Graham said: 'Hannah is beyond precious to us, and we are devastated by her disappearance. It is totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play.'We are in constant contact with the Charlottesville Police Department (CPD) and the University of Virginia.'We have learned has received many helpful leads from the leads from the public. We are very grateful for all the information already provided and urge members of the public to continue to call the dedicated tip line, with anything at all, however small it seems.'We would also like to recognize the many messages of support we have received from Hannah's friends at UVA, her friends from high school, band and soft ball team, as well as our neighbors, friends and work colleagues, too many to count.'Although we are British, Hannah has lived in Virginia since she was five. This is her home and we have always felt welcome here.'We are so grateful for everyone involved in the search for Hannah. Like you, we will not rest until we find her and she comes home.   
   Police have released this missing poster and are asking anyone with information to contact them 
  Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo speaks at a press conference on Wednesday, September 17, 2014 along the downtown pedestrian mall in Charlottesville, Va. where Hannah Graham was seen by an eye witness at a nearby restaurant on 2nd Street  
   Heartbroken and hopeful: Hannah with her brother, James, mother, Sue and father, John. The Graham's issued a joint statement on Tuesday saying they are hopeful Hannah will be found  
 With friends: Hannah with a group of friends who have all described her disappearance as extremely uncharacteristic Police Chief Longo said he was pursuing 'an aggressive investigation' to find Hannah and he described her disappearance as every parent's worst nightmare.He said he had met with Mr and Mrs Graham today and was clearly moved by their plight.He said: 'You can only imagine. As a parent and as a husband you can imagine what they are going through these past several days.'Our focus is to find their daughter and by the grace of God return her to their care.'Chief Longo said investigators had received over 100 calls to the dedicated Hannah Graham tip line and he urged anyone who 'may have seen or heard anything on the Friday night and Saturday night' to call.He said although 'straight A' student Hannah is under the legal age for drinking she should not be judged for being drunk.Chief Longo said: 'We had reason to believe she was under the influence of alcohol. I think it's extremely important to point something out.'Folks have gone very quickly to this issue and attacked the character of this young lady.'The reason that information came out as from an investigative stand point, was because it suggests the fact that she was vulnerable. That she may not have been in a position to protect herself. And so we thought it important to get that information out publicly.'It also speaks to the fact that not only was she vulnerable that she may not have been in a position to make good decisions.'I find it unfortunate that some people are latching on to that and despoiling this young lady's character.'Chief Longo said investigators had obtained video footage from across the city and had also seized electronic equipment from Hannah's apartment.Hannah Graham is alleged to have ventured into a poor neighborhood in the early hours of Saturday morning, according to residents.The student is known to have sent a text message saying she was lost.Investigators were spotted following blood hounds around Friendship Court, a low income housing development across the railway tracks from Charlottesville's upmarket Downtown Mall area.Shop keepers have offered police video footage which appears to show the 18-year-old student walking through the red-brick pedestrian street.And it appears that Hannah may have cross the tracks into Garret St, a notorious area of Charlottesville close to the city's Old Town.One resident told Mail Online: 'There were police with blood hounds down here yesterday. The dogs were following a trail around Friendship Court and men were searching through the bushes.'Another resident added: 'I heard about the missing girl and then I saw the police and detectives come through the area.' 
  Shell Station. Hannah was seen outside this station at 12.55 amAnother witness has come forward to say that they saw Hannah at 1am approaching Charlotesville downtown mall, adding to the confusion as to why she was walking away from her friends and where she lived. Authorities have said they do not know why she texted her friends at 1.20am to say she was lost near to the UVA campus - an area she knows very well - and said the new footage will change the whole focus of their search for Hannah.Hannah was last seen by friends at Camden Plaza Apartments, in Charlottesville at 11.50pm on Friday night at a party with another male friend and police have said she was heavily intoxicated.At 1.20am, friends waiting at a party for the student got a text from her saying that she was lost in the area around 14th and Wertland Streets, which is near the student's own off-campus home.However, the new surveillance footage released on Wednesday places her half-a-mile away at the Charlottesville downtown mall just 20 minutes before the text.The 5'11' softball player, whose parents are English, was wearing black pants and a gold top that had black mesh cut outs on the evening she went missing.The search for the northern Virginia woman has involved local police, the Virginia State Police, University of Virginia police and the FBI, which is processing leads, Pleasants said. The search has also included canine teams and helicopters.Asked if investigators were fearful Graham was abducted, Pleasants said, 'Right now there's nothing that points to anything criminal. However, we're obviously not discounting anything.'The FBI has confirmed that it is involved in the search as authorities admit the teen is at least the fourth young woman to go missing in the area in the past five years.

Missing UVA student Hannah Graham is the FIFTH young woman in five years to vanish along 'Route 29 corridor' - and only one body has ever been found    Missing student Hannah Graham is one of five young women to have disappeared from the Charlottesville area in the past five years within a few minutes' drive of the same Route 29 highway.As the FBI, police and volunteers continue their desperate search for the 18-year-old and her parents said they fear 'foul play', the mother of one of the young women who vanished said the worry of not knowing is the hardest part to bear.Gil Harrington suffered months of despair after her 20-year-old daughter Morgan disappeared from Virginia Tech University (UVA) in October 2009 while attending a rock concert. Her body was not recovered until three months later, hidden at a remote farm. She had been raped before she was murdered. Mrs Harrington said: 'You kind of go down the rabbit hole again of anguish. My heart goes out to Hannah's family. It is all about their girl, their beloved daughter.'Mrs Harrington, 57, from Roanake added: 'I hope and pray that Hannah is somewhere and is recoverable and will come walking through the door with a sheepish look on her face any moment now. 'That's my hope. But my logic tells me that is unlikely to happen. I'm really holding out hope that we can have a good outcome.'  
   Missing on Route 29: Five women have gone missing in and around Charlottesville, Virginia, just a few minutes' drive from the same highway in the last five years. The body of just one has been found so far

She has previously said that a serial killer was responsible for Morgan's murder.Mrs Harrington said: 'My own daughter was abducted in the area that Hannah went missing. Morgan was abducted and murdered in Charlottesville in 2009. We know that the person involved with Morgan's case was a serial offender.
