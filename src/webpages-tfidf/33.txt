Missing Hannah Graham father: 'this is every parent's worst nightmare'

  anyone with any information on his daughter's whereabouts to call a police 
  tip line

The parents of a British-born student who went missing a week ago in Virginia 
  have made an emotional plea for her safe return, holding up her favourite 
  soft toy as they begged for help to find her.


Hannah Graham has not been seen since getting lost while intoxicated and on 
  her way to a party near the University of Virginia in the town of Charlotte 
  where she was studying. 


Police have named Jesse “LJ” Matthews, 32, a nursing assistant who is thought 
  to be the last person to have seen her alive, as a “person of interest” in 
  her disappearance.


A warrant has been issued for his arrest on driving charges after police said 
  they did not have enough evidence to detain him over Hannah’s disappearance.


In an emotional press conference, the 18-year-old’s parents John and Sue, who 
  are originally from the UK and moved to Washington DC when Hannah was five, 
  said all they wanted was her safe return.

Mr Graham said: “As this nightmare for Hannah, for us, for Hannah’s big 
  brother James, her grandparents and extended family continues we would like 
  to make this statement.


"Hannah is our little girl, our only daughter, James’s little sister. She is 
  also the oldest granddaughter of her grandparents. She is enormously 
  precious to us.


"Now somebody knows what happened to Hannah. We don’t know who that is. Others 
  who may be watching, they may know something about what happened to Hannah.


“Did anybody see Hannah? Did you see Hannah? Who saw Hannah? Somebody did. 
  Please if you have anything no matter how insignificant you think it may be 
  please call the tip line.


"Anything that just might help us to bring Hannah home.”


Holding a stuffed white rabbit Hanna called Bibi, Mr Graham said the soft toy 
  had been her “constant companion and guardian angel” until she left it 
  behind when she returned to the University of Virginia last month.  


When she was six, she had lost the rabbit for three months. Mr Graham went on: 
  “We found Bibi and we brought him home to Hannah. All we want to do is to 
  bring Hannah home safely and please, please, please, help us bring Hannah 
  home.” Mrs Graham left the room in tears.


An warrant was issued for Mr Matthews’ arrest after he turned himself in at a 
  police station on Saturday but then left having asked for a lawyer, 
  allegedly speeding as he drove away.


Police said he refused to discuss Hannah’s disappearance, despite being seen 
  with his arm around her waist on a surveillance video taken at a mall, where 
  they are thought to have met at a restaurant.
