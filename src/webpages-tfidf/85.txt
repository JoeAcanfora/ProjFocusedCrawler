RICHMOND, Va. — The search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Elizabeth Graham has expanded outside of the Charlottesville area.
Her photo now appears on digital billboards in Virginia, along with a toll-free number for tips from the public.
Once alerted by request from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC), the Outdoor Advertising Association of America (OAAA) activated an endangered missing persons alert on 12 donated full-color digital billboards in Fredericksburg, Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Colonial Heights and Hopewell.
Graham, 18,  was reported missing the afternoon of September 14. She has not been seen or heard from since early Sept. 13.
Anyone with information regarding Graham’s whereabouts should call (434) 295-3851 or 1-800-THE-LOST.
Police have issued a wanted poster and released the photo of Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr.
Matthew, 32, is wanted for misdemeanor reckless driving, however Charlottesville Police have called him a Person of Interest in Graham’s disappearance.
All surveillance videos in this case can be seen here. All reports filed on this case can be found here.
 


One of Hannah Graham’s last tweets was about helping a drunk woman

I will say what some others may think but be hesitant to say out of understandable concern, deference and sensitivity to M/M Graham:  while it’s laudable that there are now 12 large highway billboards across Virginia with Hannah’s face and MP poster, I fear it will do no good.
I fear that Hannah never made it out of the Albe./CV community.
Those same billboards may have been put to better use by displaying JM’s wanted poster.  He has no doubt fled the Albe./CV area but could well have been–or still be–spotted somewhere in VA.  At the very least his sister’s vehicle described in the wanted poster may be spotted.
In suggesting the above I appreciate that: a) the sponsor of the billboards (NCMEC/OAAA) focuses on MPs, not the POIs/wanteds; and b) there may be later, potential legal challenges if/when early focus is on a POI (read:  not “suspect”).
