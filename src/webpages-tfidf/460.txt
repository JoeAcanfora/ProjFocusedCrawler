The Campbell County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the possibility the man charged with abducting University of Virginia student Hannah Graham earlier this month is connected to the 2009 homicide of a Campbell County woman.
Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 32, faces one count of abduction with intent to defile in the disappearance of Graham. The 18-year-old, second-year University of Virginia student last was seen Sept. 13 in Charlottesville.
