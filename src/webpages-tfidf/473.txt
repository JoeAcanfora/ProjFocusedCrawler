SALT LAKE CITY – Police are searching for a man who allegedly robbed a bank Saturday morning. 
The incident occurred at a Wells Fargo bank at 300 S. State Street around 11 a.m. when the suspect entered the bank and gave a teller a note indicating he had a gun and was demanding money.
The suspect fled on foot after the teller complied. 
Lt. Mike Ross of the Salt Lake City Police Department said they are still searching for the man.
“Nobody was hurt, thank goodness, and with our robbery detectives on it I’m sure we’ll track him down,” he said. 
The suspect is described as a black man between the ages of 55 and 60. The man had curly gray hair and was wearing glasses. The man is described as being about 5-feet 8-inches tall with a heavy-set build. 
Anyone with information about the crime or the suspect is asked to contact police at 801-799-3000.
