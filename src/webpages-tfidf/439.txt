Arrest warrant issued for mom



On Saturday, police said Hoggle told investigators that her two children, who have been missing since last Sunday, are alive and safe.
After receiving a 911 call about 11:15 p.m. Friday, police located the 27-year-old Clarksburg woman, who was being sought on misdemeanor child neglect charges, walking in the area of Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive.
Police say they believe Hoggle had been living on the street since her disappearance.
Her children, 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle were not with her when she was taken into custody and questioned by detectives. Police said they still had not been located.
Catherine Hoggle is diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia and family members said she had recently gone off her medication.
Police said Hoggle slipped away from her common-law husband, Troy Turner, on Monday after she was not forthcoming about the children's whereabouts. Turner called the police on Monday at around 8 p.m. to report all three missing.
Many hours earlier before finding her on Friday, police had released video surveillance of Hoggle that had shown her last verified sighting, which was in Germantown on Tuesday. The children were not with her in that video either.
