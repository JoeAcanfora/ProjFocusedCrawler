Virginia Tech lends drones to search for Hannah Graham

Virginia Tech drones have taken to the skies in Albemarle County to help police in the search for missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham.
Police first reached out to Tech’s drone experts a couple of days ago asking for help as they try to comb through some “tough terrain,” according to Tech’s Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership Director Rose Mooney.
The Federal Aviation Administration granted emergency permission in just a couple of hours, and all the details were worked out in just a couple of days.
Mooney said Tech’s team arrived with two drones Wednesday afternoon.
The drones, a DJI F550 and Aeryon SkyRanger, both look like helicopters with multiple rotors and are equipped with traditional and infrared cameras.
According to the SkyRanger’s brochure, it’s a military-grade unmanned aircraft system capable of flying and transmitting high definition video for about 50 minutes at a time.
Mooney said the drones are able to fly lower than manned aircraft, which will give them a better look at the ground below.
They plan to stay for as long as they’re useful.
“We believe this is a high priority,” Mooney said. “This is important work. That’s what UAS are very good at and we’re very happy we are able to assist here and we’re hoping we’re able to help them find something that’s significant to find Hannah. It’s all about finding Hannah.”
Police departments across the country have started using drones for these kinds of searches, but it’s still far from common.
Albemarle County Police Chief Steve Seller said during a Wednesday news conference this is the first time he’s aware of law enforcement using drones for a search in Virginia.
Most practical uses of the technology have been banned in the United States as the FAA continues to develop rules for how drones can safely be incorporated into the national airspace alongside traditional planes. However, exemptions do exist for operations such as searches for missing persons.
Tech was named one of just six FAA-certified drone test sites in December, meaning the university is able to fly research missions without jumping through all the usual hoops.
Mooney said it also means the university has a strong working relationship with the FAA, which helped get the quick approval for this mission.
This is the first time Tech has been involved in any search like the one in the Graham case.
“We’re hoping to be able to assist more and more to help police departments with these types of operations,” Mooney said. “Because the quicker you can find someone who’s lost, the better it is.”
Police began searching for Graham shortly after she was reported missing in Charlottesville in the early hours of Sept. 13.
Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. has been arrested and charged with her abduction, though Graham has yet to be found.
The search for Graham has now expanded to Albemarle County, an area authorities say Matthew knew well.
