Arrest warrant issued for mom



Police located the 27-year-old Clarksburg woman, who was being sought on misdemeanor child neglect charges, after an extensive search operation targeting areas of the county that they believed Hoggle may have visited recently.
Authorities said Hoggle was taken into custody after she was found walking in the area of Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive about 11:15 p.m. She was transported to police headquarters for questioning by detectives, police said.
Her children, 3-year-old Sarah Hoggle and 2-year-old Jacob Hoggle, who were last seen on Sunday, were not with her and police said they still had not been located.
Catherine Hoggle is diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia and family members said she had recently gone off her medication.
Police said Hoggle slipped away from her common-law husband, Troy Turner, on Monday after she was not forthcoming about the children's whereabouts.
Many hours earlier on Friday, police had released video surveillance of Hoggle that had shown her last verified sighting, which ironically was in Germantown on Tuesday. The children were not with her in that video either.
