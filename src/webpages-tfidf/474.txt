SALT LAKE CITY – Authorities are searching for an armed suspect accused of holding up a convenience store overnight.
Police said a Caucasian man wearing a grey hooded sweatshirt walked into the store at 1692 W. North Temple at about 11 p.m., told the clerk he had a gun and demanded money.
Officers said the suspect told the clerk he wasn’t giving him enough money and flashed the gun in his waistband.
At that point the clerk emptied all the money from the register and the suspect ran from the store.
Detectives said they hope surveillance footage can help identify the suspect.
