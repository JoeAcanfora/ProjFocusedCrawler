Jesse Matthew Jr. wanted for abduction of Hannah Graham

(CNN) — Authorities have obtained an arrest warrant for Jesse Matthew, charging him with abduction with the intent to defile, in the case of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo told reporters Tuesday.
Police believe Matthew was the last person with Graham before her disappearance. She was last seen September 13 in an area of Charlottesville known as the Downtown Mall.
The Charlottesville Police Department is circulating a wanted poster for the 32-year-old Matthew, who is also wanted for two counts of reckless driving.

He is described as an African-American man, standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and weighing 270 pounds. He is known to have contacts in Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Washington, D.C.
Longo declined to provide additional details on the case.
“Between now and the time that this matter goes to trial, we need to be very sensitive about the information that we share,” he said.
However, the police chief stressed: “We absolutely are continuing our search for Hannah.”
On the evening of September 12, she was seen at a party before friends saw her at an apartment complex a couple of blocks away. That was shortly before midnight, according to a time line compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR.
About 12:45 a.m. on September 13, a surveillance camera caught her outside a pub, about three-quarters of a mile from the apartment complex. A doorman turned her away at the pub, Longo said Sunday.
Ten minutes later, she is seen running past a gas station — no one appears to be pursuing her — and witnesses say they saw her five minutes later roughly four blocks from the gas station, WVIR reported. She was at a restaurant, witnesses said.
The surveillance camera at an Italian cafe captured her walking along the mall about 1:06 a.m. The camera at a jewelry store recorded her passing two minutes later, WVIR reported.
At 1:20 a.m. she texted her friends to say was lost and trying to find a party, WVIR reported. She and a man were seen having drinks at a bar between 1:30 and 2 a.m., WVIR said.
Police believe she may have been under the influence of alcohol, and may have been vulnerable or unable to defend herself.
They are are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to her safe return.
Graham, 18, is a second-year student at the University of Virginia.
“Hannah is beyond precious to us,” her parents said in a statement released shortly after her disappearance. “We are truly devastated by her disappearance. It’s totally out of character for us not to have heard from her, and we fear foul play.”

Why was a nice white girl even having drinks with a black man at 1:30 in the morning, after already being intoxicated.  That was just asking for trouble right there.

Like him being a black male has anything to do with it.. If she wasn’t being irresponsible and wasnt drinking at 18 years old in an unfamiliar place, ALONE, I don’t think this would have happened. Him being black and a male doesn’t make him more capable than an asian, caucasian, or hispanic male.

And I am not on his side or anything. I just believe that his race has nothing to do with it. I hope the young lady is returned home safely and this man is put to justice.

Why did he speed off so fast at the police station that made him look guilty like he did something. Why would he follow her not knowing who she was these are the questions the police need to ask him. They need to do a lying detectors test on him to see what He’s lying about. They need to find a physic who can see where she is. Why haven’t they done any of this? Why wait to speak to him when they can get ahead of him. I believe he done something with her maybe he hired someone to take her to tie her up or kill her. I just hope the police get with it soon and do something to find her if she is alive they can save her before its to late.

I believe he killed the others why would there be blood In his car if it wasn’t from Hannah Graham? Why would there be ladies clothing in his car? If its not from Hannah Graham then they know they have a serial killer on there hands. They need to keep this creep locked up Til they find Hannah if she is alive this would be her chance of survival while he’s locked up. I pray Hannah is alive and she will come home to her parents and family. My main concern is she has been missing for a week and no result of her I hope and pray he didn’t kill her and throw her in the beach where he was camping at maybe that’s where he put the others maybe that’s why there bodies have never been found.
