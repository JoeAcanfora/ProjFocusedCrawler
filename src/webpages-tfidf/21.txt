CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA (WWBT) -
            Law enforcement has been very tight-lipped about how they're bringing Jesse Leroy Matthew back to Virginia and at which airport he'll land. Sources say given the more than 1200 miles between Galveston and Charlottesville, authorities will fly Matthew back to Richmond. 
He left Galveston County jail around 1:45 p.m. He was taken by deputies to rendezvous with Virginia police who will return him. Passengers told NBC12 Friday they are mixed as to whether they'd feel comfortable on a plane with a fugitive on board.
While we may not hear about it often, flying a prisoner back to the jurisdiction where he's facing charges is not out of the ordinary. "I think it's safe to say probably on a daily basis," law enforcement expert and private investigator Bubba Bates said of how often police make this kind of trip.
Upon hearing the news it is possible Jesse Matthew is on a plane to Virginia to face charges in Hannah Graham's disappearance, passengers we talked to have their questions about how safe this might be.
"He'll be chained up to the point where he won't be any type of threat to anyone on the aircraft," Bates explained.
Thursday night, authorities said they would try to take Matthew on the most direct route they could find. That has experts leaning to a flight to Richmond. 
 We've learned there are two direct routes from Houston to Richmond a day and none between Houston and the Charlottesville airport. There are only a few locations that fly directly to that smaller airport. So, the unlikely flight into Charlottesville could mean a layover for Matthew and police."Most departments have taken that training so that they can and they have a team designated to use specifically for this type of purpose," bates added.
 The next direct flight from Houston is scheduled to arrive at RIC at 10:46 Friday night. It is a United Airlines flight.
