        Burkina Faso - Education
      






 



        Though education is listed as compulsory for all children aged 7 to 14,
        attendance is not enforced. All public education is free. The language
        of instruction is French. As of 1999, public expenditure on education
        was estimated at 3% of GDP.
      

        Primary education lasts for six years and secondary for seven years.
        Secondary education consists of either a general or technical course of
        study. Projected adult illiteracy is projected at only 77% for the year
        2000 (males, 66.8%; and females, 86.9%). As of 1999, 35% of
        primary-school-age children were enrolled in school, while 8% of those
        eligible attended secondary school.
      

        In 1996 primary schools enrolled 700,995 pupils and had 14,037 teachers.
        At the secondary level in 1993–94, students enrolled in general
        education numbered 116,003 while those in vocational training numbered
        8,808. There were 3,346 general education teachers at the secondary
        level. The pupil-teacher ratio at the primary level was 50 to 1 in 1999.
      

        The Center for Higher Education was established in 1969, and in 1974 it
        became the University of Ouagadougou. In 1997 there were 8,911 students
        and 352 teachers in all higher level institutions.
