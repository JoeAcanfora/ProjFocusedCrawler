Special fish
 
Adama is off to see some very special local inhabitants. They’re silures, huge carnivorous fish. Take a look at these amazing creatures as they surface. You’ll be able to see why they’re also called catfish.
The silures are an emblem for the region. Adama has brought some bread to attract them. But he’s not using the bread as bait. The locals don’t catch these fish, because they’re considered sacred.
Many people come to the waters and bring sacrifices, such as chickens. With such offerings, they believe their requests will be granted. This is why the locals refer to the fish as fetiches, something which is believed to have spiritual or magical powers.
When asked by Adama if he believes the fish have magical powers, one local man says “if we don’t believe in them, who will?”
