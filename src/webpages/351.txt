Crowds danced in the dusty streets of Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou yesterday, cheering and blowing whistles after President Blaise Compaoré resigned amid mass demonstrations against an attempt to extend his 27-year rule in the West African country.








General Honoré Traoré, the joint chief of staff, has assumed power, state radio announced. Mr Compaoré, who took over in a 1987 coup, had attempted to defy popular pressure for him to step down after a day of violent protests on Thursday in which demonstrators stormed parliament and state television.However, with hundreds of thousands of protesters packing the streets for a second day yesterday, and no sign of international support, Mr Compaoré announced his resignation. “I declare a vacancy of power with a view to allowing a transition that should end with free and transparent elections in a maximum period of 90 days,” he said in a written statement read out on local radio and television.A heavily armed convoy believed to be carrying Mr Compaore was seen travelling yesterday towards the southern town of Po, near the border with Ghana, two diplomatic sources and local media said.The joyous mood created by the resignation cooled, however, as it became plain that military chief General Traoré had taken over.

Under Burkina Faso’s constitution, when the president resigns the head of the National Assembly should take office, but parliament had already been dissolved by General Traoré on Thursday. “Considering the urgency of saving the nation, I have decided that I will assume from this day the responsibility of the head of state,”  he told a news conference. “I undertake a solemn engagement to proceed without delay with consultations with all parties in the country so as to start the process of returning to the constitutional order as soon as possible.”According to some unconfirmed reports, army Colonel Isaac Zida said yesterday that the country’s constitution had been suspended – but it was unclear whether he was speaking for General Traoré.Many protesters said they wanted a transition led by retired General Kouamé Lougué, a popular former defence minister, who was accused of trying to topple Mr Compaoré in 2004.This is a sub-Saharan Spring and it must continue against all the presidents who are trying to hang on to power in Africa,” said law student Lucien Trinnou, referring to the Arab Spring that toppled several long-term leaders.Reuters
