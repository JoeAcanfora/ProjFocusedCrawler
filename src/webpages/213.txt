Press in Burkina Faso must be protected amid anti-government protests


Lagos, Nigeria, October 30, 2014--The Committee to Protect Journalists is alarmed that protesters stormed and looted the offices of Burkina Faso's national broadcaster Radiodiffusion Television du Burkina in the capital, Ouagadougou, today. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest a constitutional amendment that would allow President Blaise Compaore to seek re-election next year, according to reports.

Jailed Burkinabe journalist appeals to African Court 

By Mohamed Keita/CPJ Africa Advocacy Coordinator
 Journalist Lohé Issa Konaté has been imprisoned in Burkina
Faso since he was convicted
in October of criminal defamation over articles in private weekly L'Ouragan alleging corruption and abuse
of power at the office of the public prosecutor. In May, an appeals court rejected
his appeal and upheld the 12-month sentence, according to defense counsel
Halidou Ouedraogo. Now, after exhausting all domestic legal remedies, Konaté has
filed a complaint with the African
Court on Human and Peoples' Rights in Tanzania.

Samuel Kiendrebeogo: 1949-2012

By Mohamed Keita/CPJ Africa Advocacy Coordinator

magazine Médias
d'Afrique et D'Ailleurs on Voice
of America's French service. Sam, as he was known, died

In Norbert Zongo case, 12 years of impunity

By Mohamed Keita/CPJ Africa Advocacy Coordinator
 For Geneviève
Zongo, every December 13 revives excruciating memories of the loss of her
husband Norbert Zongo,
editor of the weekly L'Indépendant. He was
assassinated in 1998 while investigating the murder of a driver
working at Burkina Faso's presidential palace. More painful still is that the killers
who ambushed Zongo's car, riddling it with bullets and torching it, have never been
brought to justice.

Africa's path to press freedom goes online 

By Ramata Soré/CPJ Guest Blogger
 Fifty years ago, development journalism helped to silence dissenting voices:
One had to rally to the fathers of the nation for the sake of national unity.
Accordingly, the legacy of these 50 years of Francophone media in Africa is freedom of the press and opinion. Journalists prod the
elites, who are allergic to criticism, and require that they account for their handling
of power and assume responsibility in the face of the various scandals they cause.
Recently in Burkina Faso for instance, a government minister had to resign
 after the print media revealed his extramarital affair with a married
woman. This was unthinkable a few years
ago.

A springtime for Burkina Faso’s press

By Roger Nikièma/CPJ Guest Blogger
 
I will continue to relive for a long time August  5, 1960, the day Upper Volta,  as Burkina Faso was then  known, proclaimed independence from France! As a presenter of the newly  founded national radio network, I was on the air, which was open to listeners  all night. Some listeners, with tears of joy on their faces would enter the studio  singing or reciting epic poems! As much as I loved the radio days of my debut  in journalism, I have mixed feelings about the first decades following Independence.
