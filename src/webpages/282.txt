Vive la francophonie posts an article about the Koom la viim association's efforts to fight desertification (Fr) in Burkina Faso by planting 3,500 plants. “This initiative deserves to be known…even if it only concerns a small portion of land, these efforts contribute to cleaning and reoxygenating our planet…if thousands of projects like these are started, the earth will be made more beautiful.”
