Thousands of protesters flooded the streets of Burkina Faso's capital Sunday to express outrage over an apparent army takeover of the country following the resignation of President Blaise Compaoré.The demonstrators stomped, shouted, and blew whistles as they demanded the immediate reinstatement of a civilian government after the military staged what residents described as a "coup" over the weekend. On Saturday, following days of bloody protests that culminated in Compaoré's ouster, the military issued a statement announcing that Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Zida would preside over a "transition" government.Presidential guard soldiers were forced to fire into the air as protesters stormed the building of national radio and television broadcaster RTB, according to AFP reporters.Outside, people carried banners that read "No to the theft of our victory, long live the people!" "Zida go!" and "Zida is Judas."A few days earlier, the same square in the city's center was the site of violent protests against Compaoré. He was bidding to amend the constitution to allow himself to seek reelection in 2015 and extend his 27-year rule over the country.Army colonel assumes power in Burkina Faso after president resigns.
