FILE - This is a Tuesday, Sept, 18, 2012 file photo of Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore speaks to the media after a meeting with France's President Francois Hollande at the Elysee Palace in Paris. President Blaise Compaore stepped down Friday Oct. 31, 2014 after 27 years in power and said elections would be held in 90 days following a wave of protests against his rule. The announcement, read out on television, was a sharp about-face from the day before, when protesters stormed the parliament but Compaore vowed to hold power through next year.

OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The president of Burkina Faso stepped down Friday after protesters stormed parliament and set the building ablaze, ending his 27-year reign and sparking a struggle in the military for control of the West African country.
An army general quickly announced he was filling the vacuum left by departing President Blaise Compaore, but hours later, a colonel made the same declaration.
