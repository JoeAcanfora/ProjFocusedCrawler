Burkina Faso’s military backed Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Zida as head of state following a dispute between two soldiers who claimed power in the African country after the long-standing president was forced to resign.










Burkina Faso’s military said it won’t
tolerate acts against an army-led transition government after
the ouster of longtime president Blaise Compaore. 
The opposition, which has refused to recognize the
president named by army leaders, acted irresponsibly when it
read a statement outside the offices of state TV, Lieutenant
Colonel Isaac Zida said in a statement read to reporters
following a meeting with opposition leaders. 
“Any act likely to undermine the transition process will
be suppressed with vigor,” said Zida, who was chosen by the
military to succeed Compaore. 
Opposition supporters who led four days of protests to end
Compaore’s 27-year rule last week scheduled a march for today to
demand the military continue talks and allow them to name a
leader. 
Soldiers broke up a demonstration in the capital’s main
square yesterday, and fired warning shots to disperse protesters
who gathered at the headquarters of the national TV station. One
person was killed. 
The demonstrators had called for Saran Sereme, leader of
the opposition Party for Democracy and Change, to become the
country’s next president. 
“We’ve no argument with the military -- they are our
brothers -- but their place is in their barracks,” Sereme told
the demonstrators. 
African Response 
A joint United Nations, African Union and Economic
Community of West African States mission to the country said it
would seek to avoid imposing AU and ECOWAS sanctions for the
breach to the country’s constitution. 
Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the UN Secretary General’s Special
Representative for West Africa, said the mission had
communicated with the military leadership, and urged a speedy
return to constitutional rule. 
Zida told reporters that he has met with opposition
leaders, the U.S. ambassador to the country and Jean-Baptiste
Ouedraogo, who was president of the country between 1982 and
1983 before being overthrown in a coup. 
Thousands of people had staged a peaceful protest in the
center of Ouagadougou yesterday against the military takeover,
demanding a say in who runs the country now that Compaore has
gone. 
Street Protests 
The resignation of Compaore was the culmination of an
explosion of street protests over his plan for parliament to
pass a law to allow him another term ruling the country. 
Compaore, 63, a former army officer, seized power in a 1987
coup that killed head of state Thomas Sankara. Compaore had
helped install the Marxist in an earlier putsch. 
He won an election in 1991 that was boycotted by the
opposition, and re-elected three times in ballots that gave him
about 80 percent of the vote. 
Compaore, who showed little tolerance for dissent, was
accused of involvement in civil wars in Liberia and Sierra
Leone. He was an ally of former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who was handed to an international court in 2006 and
later convicted of aiding war crimes in Sierra Leone. 
Burkina Faso, a nation of 17 million people, ranks 181st
out of 187 nations on the United Nations Human Development
Index, which measures life expectancy, literacy, education and
gross domestic product per capita. Per capita income in 2012 was
about $650, according to the UN. 
Burkina Faso’s economy depends heavily on remittances from
an estimated 4 million migrant workers in neighboring Ivory
Coast, according to the World Bank. Agriculture employs about 85
percent of the population, with cotton as the main cash crop.
