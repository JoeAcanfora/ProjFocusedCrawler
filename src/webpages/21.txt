Latest update : 2014-11-02


The head of Burkina Faso's armed forces took power on Friday after President Blaise Compaoré resigned amid mass protests against his attempt to extend his 27-year rule.
A recap of today’s momentous events in the West African state of Burkina Faso:
 
·         Following Thursday’s violent demonstrations in the capital Ouagadougou and other towns and cities, Blaise Compaoré, 63, the man who led Burkina Faso for 27 years, issued an official statement announcing his resignation.
 
·         Compaoré had wanted to change the country’s constitution to extend his period in office.
 
·         The country’s military chief, Gen. Honoré Traoré, said he had taken over as Burkina Faso’s leader, while the military suspended the constitution.
 
·         France, the former colonial power of this impoverished, landlocked nation, has welcomed Compaoré’s resignation, but called for quick new elections and for the country’s constitution to be respected.
 
·         Compaoré’s whereabouts remained unknown on Friday evening amid reports that the former Burkinabe leader had crossed the border into Ghana.
