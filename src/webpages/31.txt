OUAGADOUGOU (AFP) - Burkina Faso prepared for another day of mass protests on Sunday as opposition and civil society leaders challenged moves by the military to step into the power vacuum left by the ouster of president Blaise Compaore.The military named a high-ranking officer, Isaac Zida, to lead the country's transition on Saturday, a day after Compaore was forced to resign as plans to extend his 27-year rule exploded into violent demonstrations that saw parliament set ablaze.Some have drawn parallels with the Arab Spring, with the developments closely watched across a continent where several other veteran heads of state are also trying to cling to power.Zida, who beat out a rival claim by the landlocked west African nation's army chief to lead the transitional government, vowed to work closely with civil society.
