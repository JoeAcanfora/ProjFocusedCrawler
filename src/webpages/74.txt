The president of Burkina Faso resigned on Friday after 27 years in power, abruptly swept from office by a popular revolt only to be immediately replaced by a cast of military leaders each claiming to rule in his uncertain absence.  









        Blaise Compaoré,



       a reserved but influential leader in often chaotic West Africa, said he was relinquishing the presidency in a 








          
            Twitter
          




       posting. He called for elections within 90 days. Then he sped by car toward the country’s southern borders with Ghana, whose foreign ministry said it would welcome him. In the hours that followed, a trio of feuding army officers emerged from the country’s quarrelsome military, proclaiming themselves to be in charge. The nation’s constitution says the legislative chief is supposed to inherit the presidency. Yet, one of the contenders, Gen. Nabéré 









        Honoré Traoré,



       declared the legislature dissolved on television, Thursday night, then announced himself head of state on Friday, “to save the life of the nation,” he said. A second figure, Lt. Col. Isaac Zida, walked into a crowd of demonstrators in the capital Ouagadougou, and declared himself head of state, in a speech broadcast by Radio France Internationale.  A separate group rallied behind a third candidate, Gen. Koame Lougué, who they judged sufficiently removed from the previous regime to govern what had been until this week of the most stable democracies in the tumultuous stretch of Africa where the Sahara Desert ends.

It was a dispiriting twist for demonstrators who had thronged the streets of the capital Ouagadougou to demand the 63-year-old Mr. Compaoré step down from office then saw him replaced by the country’s military. “I find it sad,” said 









        Amadou Yaro,



       a civil servant. “We had a democracy.” The U.S. and France called on Mr. Compaoré’s successors to respect the country’s constitution, with French President 









        François Hollande



       urging the “quick holding of democratic elections.” Only days before his unexpected political eclipse, Mr. Compaoré seemed secure in office for as long he wished, confidently asking parliament to approve legislation on Thursday allowing him to seek another five-year term as president. Such legislation would have helped him ease his way into the ranks of African leaders such as Zimbabwe’s 









        Robert Mugabe,



       Cameroon’s 









        Paul Biya,



       and Angola’s José Eduardo dos Santos, who have been in power for more than three decades. That ambition was thwarted by tens of thousands of his compatriots, who swarmed the streets of the capital Ouagadougou on Thursday, then again on Friday. They set fire to the parliament building where the vote had been scheduled to take place, among other government offices. They tore through hotels and shops seen as pro-regime. Up to 30 people were killed in rioting, a French diplomat said, citing preliminary reports.

“We wanted a change, that’s all,” said 









        Mamadou Ouattara,



       a mechanic who didn’t take part in the protests but said he approved of them. “If we people didn’t complain, it would have never happened.” Mr. Compaoré’s sudden ouster serves as a cautionary tale to African leaders who seek to extend their rule without making significant strides toward improving the welfare of their people. Leaders from Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi have recently hinted they might seek a third term. 









        Goodluck Jonathan



       is set next year to seek second term as Nigeria’s president, breaking a 2011 promise to seek just one. Many of these leaders find themselves atop an increasingly young, urban, and restless, even volatile, population. Under Mr. Compaoré’s rule, Burkina Faso has seen an explosion of young people flocking to its cities. Many seek the perks of metropolitan life—jobs, spending money, a chance to travel abroad—only to find themselves on the underside of an economy where just 5% of working age adults are employed full time, according to a 2013 Gallup Poll. Still, Burkina Faso’s poor aren’t likely to see their lives soon improved, now that a democratically-elected president has been pushed from office by rioting protesters and rival army officers elbow to fill the void. The U.S. and France have both threatened to retract aid if a coup holds; economic consequences could be swift, diplomats and analysts warned.  “It is hard enough to attract business to a landlocked African country at the edge of the desert without YouTube clips of riotous mobs running amok,” wrote said J. Peter Pham, Africa director at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, who met with Mr. Compaoré in August. In recent months, Paris and Washington sought to persuade Mr. Compaoré to give up his quest for a fifth term in office, part of quiet push for democratic reform in the band of countries that border the southern edge of the Sahara. Paris feared that an emboldened opposition, which numbers many former supporters of Mr. Compaoré, and growing civil-rights movements such as Balai Citoyen, or Citizen Broom, would inevitably lead to a confrontation with the president if he went ahead with his plan to change the country’s constitution, according to a French diplomat. In a last-ditch attempt to sway Mr. Compaoré, Mr. Hollande sent him a letter on Oct. 7, praising him for his mediation role in recent African crises and promising him Paris’s support for a prominent post in an international organization if he honored the country’s constitution and left office, the diplomat said. “You could count on France’s backing should you wish to put your experience and talents at the disposal of the international community,” Mr. Hollande said in the letter. But Mr. Compaoré remained unmoved by outside pressure and pressed ahead with his political plans despite warning signs, said the French diplomat and a U.S. State Department official. “It’s difficult to know what he really sees when he looks out there” into his country, the U.S. official said. “He’s definitely not out and about. There’s definitely an isolation factor.” Both the U.S. and the French official warned that if a military officer succeeded Mr. Compaoré, his departure from office would be regarded as a military coup. In that case, they said, Burkina Faso risks being blacklisted by many international organizations and donor countries. “That would inevitably penalize Burkina Faso’s population,” the French diplomat said.

Police had fired tear gas on protesters to try to prevent them from moving in on the National Assembly building ahead of a vote on the controversial legislation.

Since the early 1990s, Burkina Faso has been an unusually tranquil, democratic country compared its neighbors Mali, Niger, and Côte d’Ivoire, which have been beset by coups and civil wars. But to protesters who have thronged the streets of the capital this week, Burkina Faso’s democracy was skin deep, built around the apparent determination of Mr. Compaoré to rule as long as he wanted. —Inti Landauro in Paris contributed to this article.
