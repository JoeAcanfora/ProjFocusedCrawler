A state of emergency was imposed after tens of thousands went on the streets to protest against Compaore’s 27-year rule. Around 30 people were killed and 100 injured, as of Friday morning, the Australian informed.
Protestors stormed parliament and other public buildings, pillaging through offices and setting cars on fire.Despite the protests, the president appeared on television and said he would stay in charge of the country and had no plans to step down.
“I have heard the message”, Compaore said, as quoted by the Australian.
“I am available to open discussions with all parties”, he was quoted by Aljazeera.
Despite the president’s words, it was unclear who was in charge of the government on Thursday night. The army announced it had seized power and would install a transitional government. Benewende Sankara, a leading opposition member, said the army’s move was a coup. He also added that the protestors would not accept anything, but Compaore’s resignation, the Australian said.
Compaore has been in power since 1987. The current protests were triggered by his decision to mend the country’s constitution to seek re-election next year, the Telegraph reported.
Burkina Faso is a former French colony in West Africa. The country has provided France with a military base for its campaign against Islamic militants in Mali. If Compaore’s government is overthrown, it would be a headache for France and other Western powers, as the area might fall to penetration by Islamic terrorists, the Telegraph said.Add to blogSend to friendShareAdd to blogYou may place this material on your blog by copying the link.Publication code:Protests Continue in Burkina Faso as President Refuses to Step Down14:40 31/10/2014 Protestors have again gathered in Burkina Faso's capital Friday morning, after the country's president Blaise Compaore refused to resign.>>Other news of the dayPreview:Protests Continue in Burkina Faso as President Refuses to Step Down14:40 31/10/2014 Protestors have again gathered in Burkina Faso's capital Friday morning, after the country's president Blaise Compaore refused to resign.>>Other news of the daySend by e-mailYour nameE-mailTo e-mailTextAll fields are required!CodeNews is sent to e-mailCloseShareDelicious DiggSeed Newsvine/world/20141031/194894534-comment.json
