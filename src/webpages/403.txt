How some western entrepreneurs are abandoning Silicon Valley for Africa
June 3rd, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Dinfin Mulupi*
East Africa’s growing opportunities in the technology sector have proved too good to ignore for some entrepreneurs from western countries. While many people in Africa have for a long time viewed the US and Europe as the lands of opportunity, young entrepreneurs from western countries are abandoning Silicon Valley to participate in east Africa’s technology sector.

Jeremy Gordon (27) came to Kenya two years ago to work as a volunteer with a microfinance institution in Nairobi for four months.
“I just wanted to come and see how mobile money was being applied in microfinance. I had read a lot about M-Pesa. I was planning to go back to graduate school, but I decided to stay and explore opportunities here,” says Gordon.
Today Gordon is involved in a number of technology startups. … Read entire article »

Is Africa’s negative image justified? Eleven viewpoints
June 2nd, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Femi Adewunmi*
The international media is often criticised for only reporting on the negatives of Africa, with stories focusing on poverty, famine, war and corruption. Is the media biased? Or is
the way that Africa is being portrayed a true reflection of what is happening on the ground? During a recent BBC debate, Africa’s global image: Justified or prejudiced?, held in Uganda’s capital Kampala, various government officials, business leaders, journalists and bloggers, shared their thoughts on this matter. Here are eleven of the most thought-provoking opinions that emerged:
1. A journalist and analyst based in Kampala said that in order for African governments to receive foreign aid, the continent needs to be seen as a place of hardship. “Bad governments essentially need a bad image to go begging in the west. And … Read entire article »

Brazil pledges investment fund for Africa
May 12th, 2012 | Add a Comment

Africa – Brazil pledged major investment and technology transfer to Africa to repay a “solidarity debt” from a country with a huge black population to the poorest but resource-rich continent.
“Brazil must begin to repay the solidarity debt we have with Africa,” former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Thursday, in his first public address since he was diagnosed with larynx cancer in October.
The world’s sixth-largest economy “owes its current strength to the more than 300 years of slavery during which we exploited the sweat and blood of millions of Africans,” he added.
Lula gave major impetus to relations with Africa while he was in power from 2003 to 2010, making several trips to the continent and reminding his hosts there that Brazil has the world’s second-largest black population after … Read entire article »

THE CONVICTION OF CHARLES TAYLOR:  THE SHAME OF AFRICA.
May 12th, 2012 | Add a Comment

 By Chief Charles. A. Taku*
Writing in the Virginia Journal of International Law, (volume 48-Number 3-Spring 2008 at page 543) Professor Iontcheva Turner stated that “the legal and political conceptions of international criminal trials are ideal types. To some degree, all law is political….. Even at trials which are not exclusively political, there are instances in which political and adjudicative purposes clash and one must be prioritized above the other”. This statement of fact aptly
describes the … Read entire article »

Five reasons why Kenya and Africa should take off
May 12th, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Wolfgang Fengler*
A week hardly goes-by without one or more international investors announcingmajor investment interests in Nairobi, or other African capital cities.
Nokia, Nestle, and IBM are some of the companies which intend to position themselves more strongly in (East) Africa. True, their investments may still be low by international standards, but they are increasingly becoming noticeable.
On a macroeconomic level, the new Africa momentum has also been evident. Africa has weathered both the global financial crisis, and the turbulence in the Euro zone. According to World Bank’s latest economic outlook, Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to grow above 5 percent in 2012 and 2013. This would be higher than the average of developing countries (excluding China), and substantially, above growth in high-income countries. This means that at some point in this decade, … Read entire article »

Malawi: the Banda Succession
May 12th, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Nick Wright*
Malawi prides itself on being a peaceful, friendly and law-abiding country, but it is also well-known for occasional lurches in the opposite direction. The recent transfer of power, from President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died on 5th April of a heart-attack, to his Vice-President, Joyce Banda, is well within this tradition.
Although he had loathed Joyce Banda almost from the moment he had appointed her as his running-mate for the 2009 presidential election, and had seen to both her expulsion from his own ruling Democratic Progressive Party and complete isolation from government, Bingu’s obvious desire to be rid of his deputy and of her constitutional right to replace him in an emergency was thwarted by that very Constitution. He tried to do what he had done before, and more … Read entire article »

Beyond The Pitch: Insight Into The Lives of Former African Football Stars
May 12th, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Zelifac Asong
Remember the world cup in 1974 and that record 9-0 bashing of the Zaire now Democratic Republic of Congo from the then Republic of Yugoslavia or the time when African countries were rated the under dogs at major international tournaments? Remember the time when there was no African name listed amongst the global stars of the game of football or when only a handful of professional players were able to ply their trade as professionals in the hugely mediatised and competitive European scene? Well football has taking the lead in the transformation of Africa. Africa is yet to win the world cup but African countries are today dreaded and Africans rank amongst the best talents in the world today. Hard to know of any soccer adept in the … Read entire article »

Imagine feeling as though you have just donated a pint or two of blood, every day for the rest of your life.  Or that you are slowly losing your eyesight because your eyelashes are curling inward and scratching your corneas with every blink. What would it feel like to go through life with limbs so swollen that you are no longer able to use … Read entire article »

Senegalese Democracy Is On The Right Course

-Prof Souleymane Diagne on the demise of Wade
By Ajong Mbapndah L
The palpable tension in the build up the election contrasted sharply with the final outcome in the recent elections in Senegal. President Abdoulaye Wade was defeated in the second round by his former protégé Macky Sall. In a salutary show of political maturity that speaks volumes  on the state of democracy in Senegal, defeated President Wade was the first to concede with warm words of congratulations for Macky Sall. Considering that this is the second time in recent times that a seating President was not only defeated by the opposition but left power without the kind of drama and rancor that is the norm in many other African countries, Prof Souleymane Diagne says democracy is on the right path in … Read entire article »

Africa: Testimony of Isaiah Washington, Founder, The Gondobay Manga Foundation
May 12th, 2012 | Add a Comment

Following is testimony of Isaiah Washington, Founder of the Gondobay Manga Foundation, before the House Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health and Human Rights:
Good afternoon. I’d like to thank Chairman Chris Smith and Ranking Member Karen Bass for inviting me to testify before this Subcommittee today. I think the Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2012 is an important means of making U.S.-Africa trade more beneficial to Americans, which will make the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and other trade measures aimed at increasing U.S.-Africa trade more attractive to those who are not directly involved in African issues. [Image via Wikipedia.org]   I am particularly interested in the impact this bill can have on encouraging the African Diaspora in America – both the traditional Diaspora … Read entire article »
