The website Guinée Inter published an article from Jeune Afrique which reveals [fr] that: “A series of American diplomatic cables, published by WikiLeaks on Saturday, details the four-way discussions which took place between the President of Burkina Faso Blaise Compaoré, the United States, France and Morocco between the end of 2009 and early 2010. These discussions centred around the fate of deposed Guinean President Moussa Dadis Camara, as well as the future of Guinea.”
