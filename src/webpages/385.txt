Burkina Faso: With or Without Compaoré, Times of Uncertainty
July 27th, 2013 | Add a Comment

 For the first time since 1987, succession is being openly discussed in Burkina Faso. Under the current constitution, President Blaise Compaoré, in power for more than a quarter century, is not allowed to contest the presidency in 2015. Any attempt to amend the constitution for a fifth-term bid could provoke a repeat of the 2011 popular uprisings. However, even if Compaoré abides by the constitution and leaves power in 2015, his succession may still prove … Read entire article »

Burkina Faso: women succeed with self-initiated microcredit system
January 11th, 2013 | Add a Comment

 By Olivier Nyirubugara*
Women in south-western Burkina Faso have engaged in informal but prosperous trade in the last couple of years thanks to capital they raised and then fructified in the form of self-initiated, self-run microcredit. Since the introduction of the concept of microcredit in Bangladesh by Professor Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, this path has frequently been suggested as one of the most effective cures for poverty. The suggested model implies a financial institution, … Read entire article »

Burkina Faso: How Much Longer Can Compaoré Rule Last?
September 8th, 2012 | Add a Comment

 After 25 years of President Compaoré, it is unclear if 2015 elections will see change or the extension of Compaoré family rule.
By Peter Dörrie*
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso:
On October 15, President Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso will celebrate his 25th year in power. To spend that much time in office, he had to run coups against two governments. In the first in 1983, he helped his friend and fellow revolutionary Thomas Sankara become president. In the second, … Read entire article »

Brazil competes with China, India to invest in Africa
July 10th, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Teo Kermeliotis, for CNN
(CNN) — Brazil has intensified its efforts to forge closer relations with Africa recently, as the sixth largest economy in the world tries to compete with other emerging giants like China and India to take a more central role in the resource-rich continent.
Last month, Brazil’s top investment bank BTG Pactual unveiled plans to raise $1 billion to create the world’s biggest investment fund for Africa, focusing on areas such as infrastructure, energy and agriculture.
The independent bank’s fund, which comes amid a government drive to establish a strategic partnership with Africa, is one of the latest moves signaling Brazil’s increasing interest to extend its economic footprint on the continent — trade between Brazil and Africa jumped from around $4 billion in 2000 to about $20 billion in … Read entire article »

Africa’s Rising Top Model: Bertini Heumegni Surges on despite the Odds

 By Ajong Mbapndah L
It is very challenging for Africans in the competitive world of modeling but there is no turning back for Bertini Heumegni who has emerged as one of the most familiar faces on
the New York fashion circuit. Cultural differences, rejection at castings, and sometimes racism are some of the odds that weigh against aspiring models from Africa but Bertini has slowly but steadily weathered the storm and ranks about the most promising representation … Read entire article »

U.S. Committed to Expanding Trade and Investment with Africa
July 4th, 2012 | Add a Comment

By MacKenzie C. Babb*
Washington — The United States is committed to continuing to expand trade and investment in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that “represents the next global economic frontier,” according to Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson.
“In addition to hosting six of the 10 fastest growing economies in the world, a recent McKinsey study documented that Africa offers the highest rate of return on foreign investment of any developing region, and has for some time,” Carson said in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Africa June 28.
He said consumer spending also continues to rise, and 43 percent of Africans currently have discretionary income, or could be considered middle-class consumers.
“Over the past decade, Africa’s growth was widespread across sectors including wholesale and retail trade, transportation, telecommunications … Read entire article »

USAID, Western Union Boost African Business
July 4th, 2012 | Add a Comment

Washington — African entrepreneurship received a boost June 25 at the second African Diaspora Marketplace (ADM II) when 17 U.S.-based entrepreneurs were awarded grants to fund innovative business plans and promote economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa.
The grants will match ADM winners’ own funds to support growth of their businesses.
Nearly 500 entrepreneurs submitted business plans to compete for a grant as part of the ADM II competition, a collaboration of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Western Union Company and the Western Union Foundation.
“The African Diaspora Marketplace will strengthen and help satisfy demand for locally produced products and services,” said USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah.
ADM has harnessed the knowledge and resources of the U.S.-based African diaspora and entrepreneurs since its launch in 2009.
The competition addresses economic opportunity and advances … Read entire article »

Africa – home to world’s leading entrepreneur
June 30th, 2012 | Add a Comment

BY Kate Douglas*
CEO and managing director of Kenya’s Equity Bank, James Mwangi, was this month awarded the Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur of the Year for 2012.
Mwangi was picked from 59 finalists, each of whom had already been awarded the E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year in their home countries.
“This is a global recognition for Africans who are embracing the power of entrepreneurship to change the economic and social state of Africa,” said Mwangi.
With the Chinese finalist owning the largest ship building company in the world and the Canadian finalist from the biggest pharmaceutical firm, How we made it in Africa looks at why Kenya’s Mwangi walked away with the title of entrepreneur of the year.

Five African ‘boom towns’ that should be on every investor’s radar
June 30th, 2012 | Add a Comment

By Jaco Maritz
South Africa’s economic hub Johannesburg is often cited as a classic example of the ‘boom town’ effect. The discovery of gold in the 1880s led to a gold rush that transformed the dusty settlement into South Africa’s largest city in a matter of 10 years.
Across Africa there are towns experiencing rapid development, largely off the back of newfound resources such as minerals, crude oil and natural gas. To produce this list of African boom towns How we made it in Africa sought the insight of Brett Abrahamse, a director at Johannesburg-based real estate consultancy Terrace Africa.
Abrahamse says that the towns below offer attractive opportunities from a property development perspective – especially for hotel and retail developments. While the challenges and expenses of working in Africa’s more remote locations … Read entire article »

The Challenges Of Writing About Africa
June 28th, 2012 | Add a Comment

Malla Nunn*
The day my first novel was sold into the American market, my agent called to prod me about the delivery date for the next one in my South African crime series. “Your family must be proud,” she said. My parents and my long-gone ancestors had worked hard and sacrificed a lot to make it possible for me to jump from weeding cornfields to writing a novel. Of course they were proud.
I hung up the phone and sat in the sun on the back steps of my house to enjoy a moment of satisfaction. Years earlier, it was from this spot overlooking a small orange tree, that I had re-imagined the insular mixed-race community that I’d grown up in and re-mapped the dusty rural towns of my childhood to build … Read entire article »
