The first hospital to offer free clitoral repair for victims of female genital mutilation (FGM) was open to the public  its doors in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso on March 7 but the government refused to allow doctors to treat the 80 patients scheduled for surgery [fr] because of incompletion to fill in the adequate paperwork. Clitoraid, the association that sponsored the event, opines that the government was pressured by religious groups to stop the event [fr] :
Cette opération chirurgicale permet de réparer les dommages physiques encourus par les victimes de MGF. Mais l'Église catholique et ses acolytes se sont opposés à cette merveilleuse mission en menant une campagne de dénigrement à des fins purement égoïstes  
This surgery can repair physical damage incurred by victims of FGM. But the Catholic Church and its followers were opposed to this wonderful mission through a smear campaign for purely selfish reasons.
