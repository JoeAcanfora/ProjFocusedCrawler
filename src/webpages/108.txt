Fromer Senate president Roch Marc Christian Kabore now joins the opposition – Public Domain
Morin Yamongba reports that 75 members (including former ministers) of the ruling party in Burkina Faso, Le Congrès pour la démocratie et le progrès (Congress for democracy and progress) have left the party to join the opposition [fr] because of alleged lack of plurality within the party. They also oppose the proposed amendment to the constitution that would allow the extension of the presidential mandate [fr]. The next presidential election is scheduled for 2015.
