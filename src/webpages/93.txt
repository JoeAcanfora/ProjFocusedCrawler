							Ex-president of Burkina Faso flees with family						
Abidjan, Nov 1 :
Burkina Faso’s former president Blaise Compaore has fled to neighbouring Cote d’Ivoire with his family, a day after violent protests forced him to step down after 27 years in power, the Cote d’Ivoire government said Saturday.
Blaise Compaore, President, Burkina Faso
According to a statement released by the presidency, Cote d’Ivoire’s President Alassane Ouattara welcomed Compaore and his family members, but it did not specify when the president arrived in the country, Xinhua reported.
Ouattara said that he hoped the neighbouring brotherly country could restore peace and stability as soon as possible, adding that Cote d’Ivoire would closely monitor Burkina Faso’s domestic political situation.
On Thursday, hundreds of thousands of people turned out on the streets of Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou to prevent members of parliament from voting to amend the constitution, a move that would have allowed 63-year-old Compaore to compete for another term of presidency.
