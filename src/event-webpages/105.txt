The Ireland captain, Paul O'Connell, is considering retiring after the World Cup, a tournament he believes the Six Nations champions, who defeated South Africa and Australia last month, have the ability to win.
Let me paint the picture for you. Shiffrin, who became the youngest Olympic slalom champion in Sochi, passed the retired Phil Mahre and Tamara McKinney, who both won nine World Cup slaloms.

The city rarely looks anything but stunning as the backdrop of the annual fireworks display.
More than half a million people are expected to converge on Melbourne's CBD as $400,000 worth of fireworks illuminate the night sky for New Year's Eve celebrations.
Revellers have been told to watch out for a “ghost shell” firework, which resembles a giant rolling wheel in the sky. “I don't think it's been used in fireworks display of this scale anywhere in Australia before,” Melbourne Lord Mayor Robert Doyle said.
Melburnians will be treated to a spectacular fireworks display tonight, with a record of 7.5 tonnes of fireworks set to be launched across 21 firing sites and rooftops.
Melbourne will see an explosive high-rise spectacular on New Year's Eve as more than seven tonnes of fireworks are sent skywards.
Very probably the single and most iconic New Years Eve fireworks anywhere in the world take place in Sydney, with the focus being the Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

And now the 25-year-old is preparing to close the chapter on one of the toughest years of her life, heading to Sydney to spend New Year's Eve with her treasured boyfriend, Aussie actor Jackson Heywood.
