Catholic survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan revisited









The image of Catholic women survivors of Super Typhoon Haiyan marching with religious conviction in Tolosa, Phililppines was one of the most iconic news photographs of 2013. It rightly won a top award in the World Press Photo competition for AFP photographer Philippe Lopez and came to symbolise the triumph of hope and belief over adversity. Now fellow photographer Ted Aljibe has been back to take new portraits of those brave women
