By  Cris Larano 
 



Roadwork in Manila
Bloomberg News


The Philippine government is betting on increased infrastructure spending to sustain economic growth, which slipped below expectations in the first quarter after a string of natural disasters late last year hobbled domestic output.
The Department of Budget and Management has laid out a plan to bolster government spending on public infrastructure–roads, airports, water supply, transportation–to 5% of gross domestic product by the time President Benigno Aquino III leaves office in 2016, up from 1.8% when he took power in June 2010.
The government plans to spend 399.43 billion pesos ($9.1 billion) on public works this year, or around 3% of GDP. That’s projected to rise to 826 billion pesos by 2016.
Last week, President Aquino and his cabinet approved nine projects worth $1.4 billion, the biggest of which is a $425 million dam-and-water-tunnel project that would supply 600 million liters of water a day to the capital by 2020.
Another project is a $325 million, 10-year contract for the operation and maintenance of Manila’s electric train systems.
But policy makers, including Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, acknowledge the increased spending won’t be enough for the Philippines to make up for years of underinvestment relative to its Southeast Asian neighbors.
According to the World Bank’s 2014 Logistics Performance Index, a benchmarking tool that compares trade logistics in 160 countries, Philippine infrastructure is the worst among the six Southeast Asian nations ranked, including Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia. The Philippines ranked 75th on the list, with a score of 2.6 out of a maximum of 5.
The amount needed for infrastructure investment in the region is staggering. The Asian Development Bank estimates that between 2010 and 2020, the Asia-Pacific region will require $8 trillion in funding for various infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, transportation and telecommunications. Southeast Asia itself will require $60 billion a year, the ADB says.
Philippine policy makers hope the private sector can help close the gap through public-private partnerships, as well as investments in sectors where the government is prohibited by law from investing except under certain conditions, such as the power sector.
Among major projects under way is the NLEX-SLEX connector road, a six-lane, 14.8-kilometer elevated highway connecting toll roads to provinces north and south of Manila. The project, being financed by the private sector, should be completed by 2017 at a cost of 25.7 billion pesos.
Another project is the new $10-billion Manila international airport proposed by San Miguel Corp. The current international airport is congested and badly dated, hobbling the goal of attracting 10 million tourists by 2016.
Bernard Aw, an analyst at Singapore’s Forecast Ltd., said the approval of nine projects under the government’s public-private partnership program will help get things moving.
“Faster approval and rollout of infrastructure projects will certainly inspire more confidence in both domestic and international investors,” he said. But he noted that other factors are equally important in attracting foreign investment, such as a stable inflationary environment, low interest rates and political stability.
In a recent report, DBS Group said infrastructure spending will help the Philippines recover from a disappointing first quarter, when the economy grew at a slower-than-expected 5.7% on-year. DBS expects the Philippine economy to grow 6.3% for the full year.
Last year the Philippine economy grew 7.2%, the fastest pace in Asia after China.
HSBC economist Trinh Nguyen said the increased spending for public infrastructure will drive growth moving forward, but is no magic bullet.
“The issue with the Philippines has always been not enough investment to capitalize on its demographic dividend, and the increase will certainly help,” she said. “Overall, the country is making gradual progress and will add up to higher investment, but this will take time.”
