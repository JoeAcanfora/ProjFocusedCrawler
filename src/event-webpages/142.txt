Super typhoon Megi hits Philippines









Three dead and power and communications cut as thousands shelter from 140mph winds

The strongest cyclone to hit the Philippines in years has killed at least three people and knocked out communications and power.
Super typhoon Megi could later hit Vietnam, where flooding has caused 30 deaths in recent days. Today floodwaters swept away a bus and 20 of its passengers, including a girl who was pulled from her mother's grasp by the current.
Authorities in China evacuated 140,000 people from their homes in Hainan province as the storm neared its coast.
Megi brought sustained winds of 140mph (225kmph) and gusts of 162mph as it made landfall at Palanan Bay, in the Isabela province of the Philippines, at midday local time.
The winds brought down trees and power lines, cutting off electricity, phone and internet services in many areas. However, it appeared to be weakening while crossing the mountains of the main northern island of Luzon.
With more than 3,600 Filipinos sheltering in school buildings, town halls, churches and relatives' homes, roads in and out of Isabela were deserted.
A man who had just rescued his water buffalo is believed to have died when he slipped and fell into a river. A woman was crushed to death in Kalinga province when a tree fell on her house, and a security guard died after being hit by a pine tree in nearby Baguio city, officials said.
They said at least six people in the province had been injured by falling trees, building debris and shattered glass.
The storm whipped up huge waves on the coast. Ships and fishing vessels were told to remain in ports, and many domestic and international flights were cancelled.
Thousands of military reserve officers and volunteers were on standby, along with helicopters, including six Chinooks that were being used by US troops holding war exercises near Manila, said Benito Ramos, a disaster response official.
"This is like preparing for war," Ramos, a retired army general, told the Associated Press. "We know the past lessons, and we're aiming for zero casualties."
In July, President Benigno Aquino sacked the head of the weather bureau for failing to predict that a typhoon would hit Manila. That storm killed more than 100 people in the capital and outlying provinces.
A 2006 typhoon with 155mph winds triggered mudslides that buried villages, killing about 1,000 people.
This time, authorities ordered early evacuations and set up emergency relief and food supplies days before the typhoon hit. The capital was expected to avoid any direct impact, though schools were closed.
In central Vietnam, officials said five people were still missing after flooding unrelated to Megi. "People are exhausted," said Nguyen Ngoc Giai, a Vietnamese disaster official in Quang Binh province. "Many people have not even returned to their flooded homes from previous floods, while many others who returned home several days ago were forced to be evacuated again."
China's national meteorological centre said Megi was expected to enter the South China Sea tomorrow, threatening south-eastern coastal provinces. The centre issued its second-highest alert for potential "wild winds and huge waves", warning vessels to take shelter and urging the authorities to prepare for emergencies.
Floods triggered by heavy rains forced nearly 140,000 people to evacuate their homes in the southern island province of Hainan over the weekend, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
