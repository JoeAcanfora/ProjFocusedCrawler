MANILA--The unemployment rate in the Philippines eased to 6.0% in October from 6.7% in July as the economy created around 388,000 jobs in the three-month period, the Philippine Statistics Office said Wednesday. The jobless rate in October last year was 6.4%. The statistics office said the latest labor force data still excludes figures from Leyte, which was hard-hit by supertyphoon Haiyan. The jobs created in the three-month period appeared to be temporary since the rate of underemployment rose to 18.7% in October from 18.3% in July and 18.0% in October last year. More temporary jobs are available in the last quarter of the year, as businesses cope with the inventory build up for the Christmas season. The data showed that in the 12 months to October, the economy created around 1.05 million jobs.
