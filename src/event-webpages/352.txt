 Disaster Response

Typhoon Haiyan


	On Friday, Nov. 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan ravaged the Philippines, leaving more than 4,000 dead, more than 1,600 missing and more than 18,000 injured. BGR helped many families with the desperate need for food, water and medicine. Now Southern Baptists and their partners in the Philippines are pursuing a longer-term strategy to help people rebuild their lives. People who care have responded generously with donations, but the recovery effort will continue for months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The task also requires considerable amounts of prayer and hard work.
