After days of preparations and evacuations, Typhoon Hagupit began to bring its ferocious wind and rain ashore in the eastern islands of the Philippines Saturday evening local time.Philippine forecasters said the large tropical system was lashing the east coast of the island nation Saturday evening. According to the Philippines Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, Hagupit made landfall near Dolores, Eastern Samar province, Saturday night at 10 p.m. The Philippines is 13 hours ahead of the United States Eastern Time Zone.Two deaths from the storm were reported by News Australia. Both deaths reportedly occurred in the eastern provincial city of Borongan.Hagupit – which translates to "smash" in Filipino – weakened slightly coming into Saturday but remains a severe threat for millions in the Philippines. The storm, locally known as Ruby, was expected to track across the Philippines along a similar route Super Typhoon Haiyan took last November. That storm killed more than 7,000 and leveled villages in what was one of the planet's worst weather disasters of 2013."Forecasts from various computer models have finally come into agreement tracking Hagupit through the Philippines starting Saturday. Hagupit is expected to track farther north than Haiyan did in November 2013, and will not be nearly as intense, but still will be likely a formidable typhoon, equivalent to a Category 3 or 4 storm," said weather.com senior meteorologist Jon Erdman. "Another concern is Hagupit's slow movement. Torrential rainfall, possibly in excess of two feet, may trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides, particularly in mountainous terrain."(MORE: Check the Typhoon Hagupit Forecast)

Homes were torn apart in eastern coastal communities on Sunday, Agence France-Presse reported. Areas in the eastern Philippines were unable to be reached, and Red Cross secretery general Gwendolyn Pang told AFP it was impossible to know how bad the damage was in these areas. Tacloban vice mayor Jerry Yaokasin reported Hagupit destroyed palm-thatch temporary houses built last year for the survivors of Haiyan by aid agencies, AFP said. As of Saturday night, the storm was damaging trees and power lines on some islands, but there were no reports of injuries, according to the BBC. Just after midnight Saturday, energy secretary Jericho Petilla told the media Samar provinces are completely without power.And as ABS-CBN News says, power outages are likely to linger until the storm has passed because employees can't do aerial surveys with such strong winds, nor will officials risk sending workers into flooded areas with possibly live wires.Evacuation estimates ticked up from half a million residents to over 700,000 across the country Sunday, according to the Philippines' National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Some Philippine officials said as many as a million people have been displaced in advance of the storm. A U.N. humanitarian agency spokesman, Denis McClean, said in Geneva that it was one of the largest peacetime evacuations in Philippine history, the Associated Press reported. It also was reminiscent of the evacuation of 1 million people along India's coastline before Cyclone Phailin hit in October 2013.(MORE: A Look Back at Haiyan's Catastrophic Impacts on the Philippines)"Evacuations have been going smoothly in the central Philippines, as well as in the northern part of the Philippines," said CCTV correspondent Barnaby Lo in a Saturday morning interview with The Weather Channel. "No one's taking any chances. People here have learned their lesson."All of the country's military, 120,000 members in total, has been deployed to help with recovery once the storm passes, Sky News reports."We're on red alert, so the entire armed forces is being mobilized for this typhoon," said Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang, head of the Philippine military, in a news conference.

As of 8 a.m. local time Sunday, the Philippine Coast Guard reported stranded sea travelers via social media:

Friday and Saturday, more than 150 flights to the central and southern Philippines were canceled by Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific, and sea travel services were halted, the BBC added.As the storm pushes northwest, metro Manila – the most densely-populated city in the world – is expected to be clobbered by intense rainfall and possibly damaging winds, GMA News says.In the days leading up to the storm's arrival, anxious residents stocked up on supplies with the memories of Haiyan still fresh in their minds. Not willing to be hungry and trapped again for days or even weeks in the aftermath of a typhoon, grocery stores were cleaned out and gas station lines were long."I'm scared," Haiyan survivor Jojo Moro told the Associated Press. "I'm praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven't recovered from the first."The 42-year-old businessman, who mourned the loss of his wife, daughter and mother last year in Tacloban, stocked up on sardines, instant noodles, eggs and water in preparation for another long weekend, the AP said.
