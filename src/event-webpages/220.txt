Typhoon Haiyan, which struck the Philippines two weeks ago, is believed to be one of the deadliest in the country's history. The category-five super-typhoon, which whipped up waves as high as five metres (16ft), caused widespread loss of life as well as destruction to homes, business and infrastructure. The cost of rebuilding devastated areas could reach £3.6bn, the Philippine economic planning minister, Arsenio Balisacan, has warned.
Although the story has dropped off the front pages, the aid effort is still in its infancy. So what's it like for those on the frontline? Is help getting through? If not, what is hindering progress? Over the next few weeks, workers involved in the relief effort will share their stories.
In the first instalment, Cecil Laguardia, a Filipina aid worker with 15 years' experience, explains her frustration with delays in aid distribution, as complicated logistics and infrastructure hinder progress. In the second blog, Crislyn Felisilda, also Filipina, describes the importance of creating safe spaces for children whose lives have been torn apart.
The world has been quick to respond to the crisis. International funding stands at £191m ($301.4m), while donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) from the UK public stands at £57m. The DEC fundraising effort uses a three-pronged approach, combining online appeals and celebrity telethons with traditional bucket-shaking on the high street.
Brendan Paddy, the committee's head of communications, says people have "responded unbelievably generously and they've done it by all channels", with many admitting to feeling obligated to help after being moved by the scale of the devastation.
Did you donate to the Philippines? If so, what inspired you to do it? What else do you want to know about the relief effort? Tell us what you'd like to read about and we'll put your questions to aid workers.
