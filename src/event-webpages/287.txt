Bodies of Water

The 
Philippines boast of many 
different kinds of natural water forms, such as bays, rivers, lakes falls, gulfs, straits, and swamps. 
Because it is made up of islands, the country's coastline, if laid end-to-end, would measure around 
17.5 thousand kilometers. The Philippines is blessed with excellent natural harbors for ports like 
Manila Bay. Other excellent harbors 
with port potentials are found in Ilocos, Pangasinan, Visayas, and Mindanao. The three largest rivers 
in the country are the Cagayan River in 
Northern Luzon, the Rio Grande de Mindanao, 
and the Agusan River, also in Mindanao. Also noteworthy in terms of size are the Agno, Pasig, 
Angat Pampanga, and Bicol rivers in Luzon. Most popular among tourist is the famous underground river 
in Palawan. Aside from rivers, the country also abounds with lakes. Easily the most famous is the 
heart-shaped Laguna de Bay. Other famous lakes are Taal in Batangas, Sampaloc in Laguna, Buhi and 
Bulusan in Bicol, Naujan in Mindoro oriental, and Lanao and Mainit in Mindanao. Generating power 
for the Nation’s growth are the magnificent waterfalls that serve as tourist attractions, as well. 
The biggest is waterfalls is the Maria 
Cristina falls, it can be found in the North Western part of Lanao province in Mindanao, while 
the most popular is Pagsanjan falls in Laguna, where tourist came in droves.

 


Natural Resources 

The Philippines is rich in natural resources. It has fertile, 
arable lands, diverse flora and fauna, extensive coastlines, and rich mineral deposits. 
About 30% of the land area of the country was determined be geologically prospective by the 
Philippine Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau. But Only 1.5% of country's land area is covered with 
mining permits. Despite the rich natural resources of the Philippines, the government is 
restricting its exploitation. A logging ban is imposed on many areas of the country and only 
in select areas are "sustainable logging" allowed. However illegal logging and 
small-scale illegal mining continues is many areas. In July 2012, President Benigno Aquino III 
ordered a stop to all mining activities in all (78 areas) protected and eco-tourism sites. 
A positive step in the right direction to protect the natural resources of the Philippines.
