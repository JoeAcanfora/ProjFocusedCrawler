Still scarred by last year's devastating Super Typhoon Haiyan, residents of the Philippines rushed Friday to stock up supplies and take cover ahead of another potentially catastrophic storm.
The eastern Philippines was preparing Friday for the arrival of a powerful storm blowing off the Pacific Ocean, just over a year after Typhoon Haiyan cut a path of devastation across the island nation.
Residents of Samar island said they were experiencing strong winds, heavy rain and blackouts on Saturday as Typhoon Hagupit churned towards eastern provinces of the archipelago.
The new storm called Typhoon Hagupit weakened slightly as it moved across the Pacific on Friday and early Saturday, falling below "super typhoon" category.
Typhoon Hagupit Filipino for “smash”  is set to hit the central Philippines between 8pm and 10pm local time, lashing parts of a region that was devastated by last year's Typhoon Haiyan and left more than 7300 people dead and missing.
Typhoon Hagupit - Filipino for "smash" - was expected to hit the central Philippines late Saturday, lashing parts of a region that was devastated by last year's Typhoon Haiyan and left more than 7,300 people dead and missing.
