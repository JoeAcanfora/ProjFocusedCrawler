Tropical storm Jangmi has left 31 people dead and seven missing after triggering massive landslides and flash floods in the Philippines, officials said Tuesday.

The storm, known locally
  as Seniang, first made landfall Monday morning in Surigao del
  Sur, a southeastern province, according to government officials.
  Prior to landfall, torrents of rain and wind plagued the region
  for three days, causing Surigao del Sur Governor Johnny Piemenel
  to declare “a state of calamity.”

  The storm sustained winds of 65 kilometers per hour, with gusts
  reaching 80 kilometers an hour lashing through the central
  Philippines on Tuesday, according to AP.

  An estimated 13,000 people were displaced from their homes due to
  flood concerns as Jangmi drifted northwest, AFP reported. Some
  1,700 had been evacuated prior to the storm’s arrival, Gulf News
  reported.


  As of late Tuesday afternoon, the eye of the storm was 140
  kilometers southwest of central Iloilo City, moving west at 19
  kilometers an hour toward western Palawan Island, according to
  the government weather bureau. Officials have reported that water
  in some areas is “neck deep.”

  National civil defense chief Alexander Pama warned that floods
  and landslides pose the greatest danger to the population.

“We are focused on floods and landslides because, while the
  storm’s winds are weak, it will bring heavy rain,” he told
  local radio.

  Olive Luces, a regional civil defense official, quoted in the AP,
  said that 11 members of a family were killed when their house was
  washed away by flash floods in central Cebu province.


  An eight-year-old Cebu girl drowned after floodwaters washed her
  home away, while two teenage boys were electrocuted to death when
  wading through floodwaters in the Bohol province, according to
  regional civil defense officer Allen Cabaron, Gulf News reported.
  Many houses, meanwhile, have been buried in landslides.

  Burst riverbanks inundated roads and highways in knee-deep waters
  while washing away bridges and cars, Cabaron said.

  Ten flights to and from the affected areas were canceled Tuesday,
  the Manila airport authority said in a statement. Jangmi is
  expected to turn away from the Philippines by New Year’s Day.


  The Philippines suffers a particularly high volume of tropical
  cyclones. On average about 20 storms per year hit the country.

  Just last month, Super Typhoon Hagupit killed 18 people and
  caused $114 million in damage as it slammed across the country.

  Last year Super Typhoon Haiyan left over 7,000 people dead and
  wiped out entire villages.
