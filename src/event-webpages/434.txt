March 14, 2014 | By Michael Sandler, UNICEF USA
The pain of loss still cuts deep in the Philippines four months after Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) killed more than 6,000 people, but there is also a growing sense that recovery is possible.
A new UNICEF report, Four Months After [pdf], describes both the progress made and the challenges that lie ahead for Filipino children. Some highlights:

14.1 million people, including 5.9 million children were affected
four months on, 4.1 million people are still displaced
nearly 3,200 schools and day care centers were destroyed

Key figures about UNICEF’s role in the humanitarian response:

930,000 people received access to safe water
430,200 children received school supplies as part of a back-to-school campaign
97,000 children have been screened for malnutrition
1.1 million children have been targeted for vaccination
17,000 children are benefitting from 89 UNICEF Child-Friendly Spaces
