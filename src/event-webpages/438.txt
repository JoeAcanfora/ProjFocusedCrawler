Super Typhoon Haiyan Strikes the Philippines


March 6, 2014


SubscribeRSS





Super Typhoon Haiyan made first landfall in the central Philippines Friday morning local time bringing relentless winds, torrential rain and a dangerous storm surge.












Thousands of Filipinos relocated in advance of the storm, known locally as "Yolanda." With wind speeds approaching 195 mph, the typhoon has been called the strongest tropical cyclone in the world this year by the U.S. Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
The Category 5 storm is traveling directly across the central region of the country, which had been devastated by a 7.2 magnitude earthquake just three weeks ago.
That earthquake, the strongest in a quarter-century, killed more than 150 people and destroyed 50,000 homes. Many of the displaced, temporarily living beneath tarps and in tents, tried to seek shelter in concrete buildings before Haiyan's arrival.
UNICEF's emergency operations center is closely monitoring the situation. With an on-the-ground presence in the Philippines since 1948, UNICEF stands ready to aid children and families affected by the storm. We will share an update as soon as possible.
Please support UNICEF’s emergency relief efforts for children in the Philippines.
