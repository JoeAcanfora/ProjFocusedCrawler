The Philippines and the UN Security Council 
Philippine Presidency of the Security Council, September 2005
On 1 January 2004, the Philippines assumed one of the elected seats in the United Nations Security Council for the term 2004-2005. 
As a member of the Security Council, the Philippines will focus its attention and energy on the following objectives:
Strengthen the collective security mechanism established under the U.N. Charter.
Emphasize the importance of the rule of law in the maintenance of international peace and security. (Its components would include, among others: establishment of institutions to ensure safety and order in post-conflict societies; prevention of impunity by violators of human rights and international humanitarian law; and protection of civilians, their rights and freedoms.)
Provide a strong basis for a multilateral consensus in pursuing the Security Council’s primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.
Counter-Terrorism
The Philippines is committed to eradicating the scourge of international terrorism. Through the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee, the Philippines will promote measures to enable this Committee and other subsidiary bodies to implement its mandates fully and effectively.
Iraq
The Philippines will coordinate closely with other delegations on future steps to achieve stability and progress for the country. The Philippines encourages the timely transfer of sovereign rule back to the Iraqi people and their duly elected government.
Asia 
In coordination with other delegations, the Philippines will support continued international presence and assistance that are tailored to the current needs of Timor Leste.
The Philippines will assist the efforts for Afghanistan by helping the country receive the extensive international support it requires towards rehabilitation and reconstruction.
Europe
The Philippines supports ongoing moves towards a multi-ethnic functioning society in Kosovo as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With regard to Kosovo, the Philippines believes that the benchmarks established by the United Nations must first be achieved before any action is taken on its final status.
The Philippines supports the efforts for the resolution of the Cyprus problem and it will continue to contribute to initiatives that will lead to a comprehensive settlement of the issue. 
Africa
The continent of Africa remains the biggest challenge for the Security Council. The Philippines is committed to Africa attaining stability and progress, which can only be possible through comprehensive peace in the region.
The Philippines will support, nurture and fortify initiatives on Africa, which will consolidate and strengthen mechanisms for conflict prevention, resolution and management, as well as promote growth in, among others, infrastructure, agriculture, health and education. These initiatives include, but are not limited to, support for regional organizations and a regional approach to addressing problems; participation in peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace-building missions; involvement in the establishment and maintenance of mechanisms for the implementation of the rule of law, such as the sanctions regimes; and support for offer of good offices or mediation.
