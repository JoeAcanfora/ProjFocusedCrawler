The United States promised $10 million in additional aid to the storm-stricken Philippines Monday, bringing the total U.S. contributions since Typhoon Haiyan to $37 million.
About 50 U.S. ships and aircraft carriers have been mobilized in the disaster zone, and 14 helicopters are air-dropping food and supplies to survivors, Reuters reports. The nuclear-powered USS George Washington led the American relief effort after Typhoon Haiyan slammed the Philippines on Nov. 8.
The Philippines has strategic importance to the U.S. as part of the Obama administration’s plans to counterbalance China’s rising military influence with strong American allies in the region. The U.S. and the Philippines are in the middle of negotiating an increased American military presence in the country.

The United States needs to stop spending Chinese money more productively.  Aiding the Philippines will produce a terrible ROI.

The Philippine government must spend its own money before requesting donations from China.
The Philippine government is sitting on $936 million that it is about
 to spend on 12 new South Korean FA-50 jet fighters for $440 million, 
two new Italian Maestrale frigates for $416 million, and eight 
AugustaWestland AW109 attack helicopters for $80 million.
Since the final contracts have not yet been signed, the Philippine 
government can divert the $936 million for immediate disaster relief and
 reconstruction.
