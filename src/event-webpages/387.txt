Five Americans were killed after Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the Philippines earlier this month, and hundreds more have received aid, a U.S. official said Tuesday.
The update came from Scot Marciel, a senior State Department official, who was testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Marciel said the U.S. has received more than 1,000 calls for information about Americans in the Philippines and that 475 people have been located so far, the Associated Press reports.
The Philippine government’s most recent death toll stands at 3,982, with another 1,602 missing and 18,277 injured. An additional 4 million people are estimated to have been displaced. On Monday, the U.S. promised an additional $10 million in humanitarian aid for the storm’s victims, bringing its total to $37 million.
