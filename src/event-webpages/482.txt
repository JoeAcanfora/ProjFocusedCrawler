L.A.’s Global Citizens Help UNICEF in the Philippines

February 20, 2014 | By Annie Kim
Annie Kim is a Global Citizenship Fellow at the U.S. Fund for UNICEF in Los Angeles, CA. 
It’s been a little over three months since Typhoon Haiyan first struck the Philippines. Though the destructive super typhoon left immense devastation in its wake, the outpouring of international support showed the people of the Philippines that they were not alone.
In Los Angeles especially — home to the largest population of Filipinos in the world outside of the Philippines — communities came together to support relief efforts. One of them was Daniel Webster Middle School, a school made up of global citizens-in-training.
Led by a teacher named Ms. Salazar, students at Webster Middle School raised $2,259.55 for children they had never met that live in a faraway country.
These students exemplified global citizenship by understanding the world’s interconnectedness. By believing that they could make a real difference in a stranger’s life with spare change, they helped UNICEF give the children of the Philippines clean water.
One person in particular was particularly moved after my presentation. A Filipino man stood up and, with much emotion, thanked the school for the support they had shown the people of his country. He talked about how grateful he was to UNICEF for being in the Philippines year after year, no matter the natural or man-made disaster.
And Lucy Meyer, our very own Spokesperson for Children with Disabilities and student at Webster, rounded out the talk by encouraging the faculty to act locally and volunteer for the Special Olympics taking place in Los Angeles next year.

Daniel Webster Middle School inspired me with its commitment to nurturing the global citizens of the future. With students like those at Webster tackling injustices and taking meaningful action, the world can rest assured that the future is in safe hands.
