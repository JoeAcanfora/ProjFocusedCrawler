InflationInterest RatesPhilippine central bankPhilippines 

















By  Cris Larano 
Though Philippine inflation eased in June, its central bank could still feel pressure to further tighten monetary policy, with a growing expectation of an increase in overnight rates, which have been left untouched since October 2012.
On Friday, the Philippine Statistics Authority announced that June inflation decelerated to 4.4% after rising to a 30-month high of 4.5% in May. June’s reading brought the average for the first half of the year to 4.2%, at the upper bounds of the central bank’s 3% to 5% target range for this year.
Still, economists predict that inflation has yet to reach its peak, which could happen in August.
These readings give the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas some discomfort, since the bank set its 2015 inflation target at 2% to 4%.
“We continue to be mindful of the risks to achieving the inflation target that remain, including second-round effects that may ensue from supply-driven commodity-price increases,” said BSP Governor Amando Tetangco.
The national weather bureau expects the dry spell that accompanies El Nino to hit the Philippines in the last quarter, which will hurt farm production and increase the cost of food products for consumers. It would also mean a higher cost of electricity given lower reserves to produce power from hydroelectric dams.
Still, Mr. Tetangco acknowledged that the central bank “will adjust policy levers as appropriate to keep a lid on inflation and ensure financial-stability pressures are in check.”
Already, the central bank has raised the banks’ reserve-requirement ratio by two percentage points to 21% and increased interest rates on its liquidity-siphoning special-deposit accounts to slow money supply growth.
Trinh Nguyen, an economist at HSBC Holdings PLC, said the central bank could act preemptively to raise overnight rates by 25 basis points during the policy meeting on July 31 from the current record low of 3.5% for borrowing and 5.5% for lending. The move would help to mop up liquidity and dampen demand, she said, adding the benchmark overnight borrowing rate could end the year at 4%.
“Production, whether it’s food or electricity, is still short of what’s needed to keep up with rising demand,” Ms. Nguyen said. “El Nino will likely exacerbate these supply constraints.”
Rahul Bajoria, an economist at Barclays, thinks that the central bank will continue to focus on raising interest rates on its special-deposit accounts, since such a move addresses excess liquidity without attracting capital inflows from overseas.
Eugenia Victorino, an economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group, Ltd., agrees that interest rates on special-deposit accounts likely will be the central bank’s preferred tool to combat inflation, raising the borrowing rate to 3% by the end of this year from 2.25% after last month’s quarter-of-a-percentage point increase. She added that a move in July will give enough time for the policy action to filter through the financial system in the light of the 15- to 24-month lag in monetary-policy transmission.
