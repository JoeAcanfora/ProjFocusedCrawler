Two weeks after Typhoon Haiyan devastated the Philippines, officials say the death toll has risen above 5,000.
The Philippines National Disaster Agency said on Friday that 5,209 lost their lives in the storm, but that the death toll may increase because many people are still missing, BBC reports. The strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall on record, Haiyan is now the deadliest natural disaster in the history of the Philippines. The death toll surpasses that of 1991 floods in the Ormoc region, where 5,101 people were killed.
Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said on Friday that the situation in the Philippines in stabilizing. Major roads on Samar and Leyte islands have been cleared of debris, but in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas, relief and recovery efforts are still ongoing.

MY COMMENT TO THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES IS; START PUTTING GOD FIRST, AND NOT HIS MOTHER MARY, THEN NATURE MIGHT HAVE A CHANGE OF IT'S COURSE.  I AM CONVICTED THAT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD IS STRIKING IN YOUR LAND, TELLING YOU THE WAY TO GO, THAT HE COMES FIRST NOT MARY. i DO LOVE YOU ALL, I HAVE BEEN THERE FOUR TIMES, BUT WHAT I SAW IN THE CHURCHES IS A BIG STATUE OF MARY, FOLLOWED BY A SMALL ONE OF KING JESUS CHRIST, THE MAKER AND SAVIOUR OF MANKIND. TRY THIS ALL MY PHILLIPINO PEOPLE, GOD IS WAITING.

@chrisrogers7850 ,,, that's all you can say because you have no social responsibilities and this story has nothing to do with your minimum wage life and your dead end job. Of course you'll state otherwise but emoting about a catastrophe says a lot about you.
