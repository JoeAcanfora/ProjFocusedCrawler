UN Activates MicroMappers for Philippines Typhoon Ruby! 

Patrick MeierDecember 6, 20140 

Dear MicroMappers,
Super Typhoon Ruby (Hagupit) just made landfall in the Philippines. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Manila has activated MicroMappers to augment their important damage and needs assessments on the ground. Our mission is to identify tweets that refer to urgent needs, infrastructure damage and humanitarian aid. We’ve also been asked by the UN to identify pictures posted on Twitter that show disaster damage. This is exactly the same request we received in response to Typhoon Haiyan last year, which you can read more about here. Anyone who has an Internet connection and speaks some English can join this digital humanitarian effort. You don’t need prior experience or super-hero skills to be a Digital Humanitarian (also known as a Digital Jedi).
Here are Clickers:

UPDATE: (December 9, 2014)
Our efforts were just featured in the UK Guardian!
Disaster assessment maps based on MicroMappers have been shared with the United Nations in the Philippines and will be updated throughout the day. To see the maps, please see the “Maps” tab in the menu bar above. Today (Tuesday, December 9th) is the final day of the deployment, so we need to give this final stretch 100% to provide our UN partners with the remaining information they need to assess the Typhoon’s impact. Please recruit your friends, family members and others, we need all hands on deck!
UPDATE: (December 7, 2014)
MicroMappers continue to respond to the Typhoon Hagupit (Ruby) activation. Here are some of the statistics to show their amazing contribution:

*****
We have created two MicroMappers “Clickers” to very easily and quickly tag tweets and pictures; we call these the “Text Clicker” and the “Image Clicker”. We use the Text Clicker to tag tweets and the Image Clicker to tag images posted on Twitter. Each Clicker has it’s own website which includes a short tutorial to help you get started. And each clicker also has a dedicated “Chat Room” where we can collaborate to help each other out. To improve accuracy, every image and tweet will be reviewed by 3 people. The Standby Task Force (SBTF) will then map all the relevant tweets and pictures we find. This map will be made publicly available so that our UN partners and other humanitarian groups can quickly assess the impact of the Typhoon and thus respond more quickly.

MicroMappers is a platform developed by QCRI and represents a joint initiative with the United Nations (OCHA). The platform is still under development, however, so we thank you for your patience and understanding if not everything is as perfect as we’d like. We’ve included a link in each Clicker tutorial to a feedback form where you can let us know how to improve the Clickers.
Please note! The Clickers may at times be out of tweets and/or pictures, in which case you’ll see the message “100% completed”. If you do see this message, this means we’re busy uploading new tweets/pictures to the Clickers. Simply give us a bit of time as we upload new tweets/clickers and check in again later.
And that’s all there is to it. Thank you very much for your time and goodwill!
Lets do what we do best, Digital Jedis!
With deep gratitude,
Your MicroMappers Team
