Haiyan brought immense destruction, but hope is returning to the Philippines.
****UNICEF is mobilizing relief for families and children affected by December 2014's Typhoon Hagupit (Ruby)—Learn More***
Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical storms on record, caused tremendous damage when it made landfall in the Philippines in November 2013. More than 6,000 people were killed. Thousands of homes were destroyed. Over 14 million Filipinos, including nearly 6 million children, were affected.
After the storm, UNICEF staff rushed to assess the situation for children and families, and deliver critical aid. Working with the Philippine government and partner humanitarian organizations, UNICEF helped provide clean water to nearly a million people, deliver emergency health kits to depleted clinics, reunite lost children with their families, and open child-friendly spaces and temporary schools for thousands of Filipino students. 
Today, the pain of loss still cuts deep, but there is a growing sense that recovery is possible. Families have water and health care, and children are returning to school. UNICEF continues to support the Filipino people in their efforts to rebuild.
