Dozens of typhoon survivors in the Philippines participated in a march Tuesday to boost spirits, singing songs like “We shall overcome” as they walked through the city of Tacloban that was devastated by the Nov. 8 storm.
Typhoon Haiyan carried some of the fastest wind speeds on record across eastern and central Philippines, leaving more than 5,000 people missing or dead, and another 4 million people displaced.
The marchers, who were led by the Rev. Robert Reyes, an activist Catholic priest, have been living in a church and a sports stadium, Reyes told the Associated Press.
“This is not an ordinary march. We call it the walk to overcome,” he said. “This is part of what we call psycho-social therapy where you listen to the victims of the disaster but you also make them believe that they can actually heal themselves.”
