Typhoon Hagupit: relief and celebrations as the storm passes



Posted by

Today the sun is shining in Manila and Typhoon Hagupit has finally exited the Philippines, leaving significantly less death and destruction than was feared. One factor in the low casualties – the latest estimate is 27, compared to over 7,000 for Haiyan last year – is the disaster risk reduction measures put in place by UNICEF, the government and partners, including early mass evacuations.

Typhoon Hagupit, known locally as Ruby, passed south of Manila overnight on Monday 8 December. The eye of the storm missed the city but there was plenty of rain and wind surrounding the typhoon, carrying with it flood risks, in particular for slum communities living on flood plains near the river.

Typhoon Hagupit passed south of Manila, capital of the Philippines, overnight on Monday. Wind and rain brought flood risks for slum communities living near the river. In Barangay Bagong Silangan, Quezon City (part of Metro Manila), an evacuation centre was set up in a covered court on the hillside above a flood plain.

Typhoon Hagupit: sunny in Tacloban, stormy in Manila

Today, Typhoon Hagupit (known locally as Ruby) has been making itself known in Manila. The winds and rain that swirl around the edge of the storm arrived early and are expected to strengthen significantly overnight. Walking to the office this morning, I braced myself against both, while an empty Starbucks cup hurtled down the street towards me.

Typhoon Hagupit: families in Tacloban have a lucky escape

Yesterday I arrived in Manila, the Philippines, a day or two ahead of Typhoon Hagupit (known locally as Ruby). Looking out to sea from UNICEF’s office on the 30th floor of RCBC Plaza, there’s no sign yet of the typhoon. There’s even a narrow band of sunlight on the horizon. But everyone knows that it’s coming.

Today we’re celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)! We’ve asked children from around East Asia and the Pacific about what the CRC means to them.

Here is what children from Tacloban, Philippines think:

Keeping our promise to the youngest children in Asia-Pacific

In 2000, the world made a promise to reduce deaths among children under-five by two thirds by 2015, compared to 1990, the benchmark year for the Millennium Development Goals. With less than 500 days left until the deadline, great progress has been made, but the world still risks breaking one of the most profound promises ever made to children.

In East Asia and the Pacific, progress is evident at the regional level with very impressive reductions in child mortality compared to 1990. However, the level and breadth of success is by no means uniform, particularly when we look at the sub-national-level and disparities within countries come to light. The major killers remain pneumonia and diarrhoea, along with more pronounced numbers in the first month after birth.

Right to be a girl: Ending child marriage in Asia Pacific

With the first Girl Summit taking place today in London, UK, I am thinking of child brides here in East Asia and the Pacific, where one in five women were married before the age of 18. Most of these girls come from rural areas and from the poorest families.

When I was with UNICEF Philippines, I remember travelling to a village in the south. I passed by a wake where four very young children were wailing beside a makeshift coffin. I stopped by to pay my respects and it was only when I signed the condolence book that I learnt that the deceased mother was only 16 years old.

Bringing water back to typhoon damaged schools

"How can I help my country when I can't even attend school because its facilities are broken down?" reasons Celina, a tenth-grader at the Ramon Arnaldo High School here, when asked why she thinks it is important to mobilize help for schools.

Super Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) blew away roofs, walls, windows, water pipes, toilets, and much more. It was saddening. "Some of our students cried when they saw what Yolanda did to their school," says Nenita Villa, principal of the Catalino Andrada Memorial School in Ivisa, Capiz. What the typhoon couldn't take away, though, was the students' strong resolve to keep on learning.

﻿
Four teachers from the Kapangian Central School here have made a pledge to ensure that their school is safe as children return this week, and that their pupils are prepared for any emergency.

They made this commitment after recently attending a two-day seminar-workshop on psychosocial support to children, Disaster Risk Reduction and Education in Emergencies. They were among 837 teachers, day-care workers and school staff who recently underwent a training course conducted by UNICEF and partners in the Typhoon Yolanda-affected areas in central Philippines.

Cash grant help families recover from Typhoon Haiyan

Michelle Postrero Lao, 22, lost her six-year-old child when Typhoon Yolanda hit her hometown of Barangay Victoria, Dagami, Leyte province. Currently eight months pregnant with her fourth child, she was injured during the typhoon when a concrete wall damaged her family’s modest hut.

Michelle and her family did not know that Typhoon Yolanda, as Haiyan is known locally, was coming. They did not own a television or radio. The remoteness of her house, located in one of the hardest-hit areas, makes it even more difficult for them.

“I have been promoted to grade four with good grades,” says Janene while holding up her results sheet.  Her sparkling eyes and glowing face reflect her happiness and pride in her achievement. 

Janene Mae Gahi, 10, is a student at Manlurip Elementary School in Tacloban. As she mingles with her friends at their graduation ceremony, Janene seems to be making her way out of the haunting memory of Typhoon Haiyan.

In Japan, children help prepare for future natural disasters

“I lost my grandparents in the Tohoku tsunami. But I don’t want other children to lose their relatives in future tsunamis,” said 12-year-old Ryusei.

These simple but strong words struck the audience at a symposium commemorating the three-year anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami on 27 March 2014. The Tohoku earthquake was one of the most powerful ever recorded. “For me, this feeling is the foundation of disaster risk reduction,” Ryusei continued. “That is why I decided to get involved in the community rebuilding project in my town.”

I recently visited Manila to find out how school communities were preparing for future natural disasters. With memories of Typhoon Haiyan still fresh, it couldn’t have been timelier. It has also been over 10 years since I last visited Manila. Being half Filipina, learning that I was invited to visit the city with UNICEF was very exciting news.

UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and football legend David Beckham spent Valentine's Day visiting children in areas of the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan.

For two days, Mr. Beckham toured Tacloban and the surrounding areas, which were among the hardest hit when the powerful storm ripped through the central Philippines 98 days ago.

Saturday 8 February marked exactly three months after Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda). On this day, after months of following the relief efforts from a distance at UNICEF’s regional office in Bangkok, I was fortunate to witness the change in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas, and talk to people affected by the typhoon.

Typhoon Haiyan: Rebuilding lives, returning to school

UNICEF EAPRO








Edegario in the UNICEF Temporary Learning Space

Edegario, 12, points to where his house used to be.  Two broken wooden poles are all that is left.  His family is now living with his uncle, in the house next door, which was also heavily damaged.  The family repaired it as much as they could with tarpaulin, panel sheets, whatever they could find out of the debris.

Edegario lives in Tacloban neighbourhood heavily affected by Typhoon Haiyan (local name Yolanda).  Three months on, the neighbourhood still bears the signs of massive devastation.  At least most of the few metres high debris has been cleared.
