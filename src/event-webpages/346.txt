Grand Central: Global Growth Worries Echo Across the Pond


 
 The Wall Street Journal’s Daily Report on Global Central Banks for Thursday, October 23, 2014:
Sign up for the newsletter.
A Wall Street Journal story Tuesday described how a slowdown in global growth threatens to undermine the US recovery. Similar concerns are plaguing policy makers in the U.K., where a long-awaited recovery appears increasingly under threat from risks emanating from overseas.
Minutes  of the October meeting of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, published Wednesday, were packed with references to increasingly downbeat news on the global economy. Officials gloomily noted that “pessimism about the global economic outlook had increased” and that a “steady accumulation of evidence” pointed to weaker-than-expected growth ahead. China, the Middle East, Russia and Ukraine all got mentioned as possible drags on that growth, as did plunging oil prices and investors’ diminishing appetite for risk. Read More »

Grand Central: Can The Fed Drop “Considerable Time” Without Spooking Markets?

 The Wall Street Journal’s Daily Report on Global Central Banks for Thursday, September 11, 2014:

The watchwords in U.S. central banking this week are “considerable time.”
As the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, a growing number of Federal Reserve officials want to move further away from the forward guidance on interest rates that has been a staple of their post-crisis monetary policy. With interest rates pinned at zero and unable to move lower to stimulate a limp economy, officials have chosen assurances rates would stay low as another way to boost financial conditions.
The promises have shifted frequently from time-oriented commitments – “extended period” – to commitments tied to the economy – “as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent” – and back to time-oriented – “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.” As the economy nears their goals of full employment and 2% inflation, the promises become less necessary and, officials hope, less binding.

Philippine Central Bank Could Raise Rates Despite Easing Inflation

By Cris LaranoThough Philippine inflation eased in June, its central bank could still feel pressure to further tighten monetary policy, with a growing expectation of an increase in overnight rates, which have been left untouched since October 2012.
On Friday, the Philippine Statistics Authority announced that June inflation decelerated to 4.4% after rising to a 30-month high of 4.5% in May. June’s reading brought the average for the first half of the year to 4.2%, at the upper bounds of the central bank’s 3% to 5% target range for this year.
Still, economists predict that inflation has yet to reach its peak, which could happen in August.
These readings give the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas some discomfort, since the bank set its 2015 inflation target at 2% to 4%. Read More »
