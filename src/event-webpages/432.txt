Of the 13 strongest typhoons on record, 5 are from this short century. Source – Weather Underground. Haiyan was the strongest at landfall.
Maybe you should (re)read the AR5 summary.
“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased.”
The ice melts. The oceans warm, rise and acidify.

Given that the data clearly shows declines in the incidence of cyclones over the past decade, along with no trend in droughts, tornados, snowfall (possibly some increase if anything) or monsoon rainfall perhaps you could point to data which supports your claims. 
Somehow your use of the term denial suggests your claims may be light on empirical data, and long on emotion, but I’m always willing to change my mind.

It has been a catastrophe. Given AGW is tilting the climate table it’s hard to see how our weather would not be affected. The denial started before the typhoon even struck.

On the contrary the alarmists have been hyping the typhoon for four days now claiming it was the result of AGW.

That’s a new low for denial, Mr Benton. And so predictable.

Interesting to see how the Met Office has fallen into line with the BBC by referring to this typhoon as “catastrophic” even before any reports of damage are assessed. Presumably this is in readiness for the inevitable links that will be made to catastrophic global warming.
it’s just becoming soooooo predictable.
