Places in Philippines













Destination


Manila



Manila’s moniker, the ‘Pearl of the Orient’, couldn’t be more apt – its cantankerous shell reveals its jewel only to those resolute enough to pry. No stranger to hardship, the city has endured every disaster both human and nature could throw at it, and yet today the chaotic metropolis thrives as a true Asian megacity.














Destination


The Western Visayas

The Eastern Visayas















Destination


North Luzon



North Luzon, a region that invites intrepid exploration, encapsulates a nation in miniature. Machete-toting mountain tribes who are quick to smile and quicker to share their rice wine. Surfers racing waves onto sunny beaches. White-sand beaches lapped by teal waters. Impenetrable jungle hiding numerous endemic critters.

















Destination


Panay



Hedonists head for Panay’s most sought- after destination: the long and luscious white-sand beach at Boracay. It’s all that many visitors to the region, or for that matter the country, ever see. Despite offering the attractions of the Visayas in a microcosm, the rest of Panay keeps a low tourism profile, which makes its other parts appealingly low-key.














Destination


Mindanao & Sulu



Despite boasting jaw-dropping beaches, killer surf, rugged mountain ranges and indigenous cultures living very much as they have for centuries, Mindanao remains off the tourism industry’s radar. Of course, the conflict that has ebbed and flowed now for several generations bears much of the responsibility.

Destination


Cebu



Simply being from Cebu carries a certain cultural heft, and it’s not hard to see why. Cebu is the hub around which the Visayas revolve. It is the most densely populated island in the Philippines and is second only to Luzon in its strategic and economic importance to the country.














Destination


Palawan



Nothing defines Palawan more than the water around it. With seascapes the equal of any in Southeast Asia, and wildlife terrestrial and aquatic, the Philippines’ most sparsely populated region is also the most beguiling. Because of its silhouette – a long sliver stretching 650km all the way to Borneo – there’s a certain liberating logic to travel here.














Destination


Negros



With its rugged mountain interior, unspoilt beaches, underwater coral gardens, distinctive indigenous traditions and urban groove, the sheer overwhelming diversity of Negros is impossible to sum up in a single gesture. Despite this, Negros has somehow managed to fly under the tourist radar, and only now is it starting to get the recognition it deserves.














Destination


The Cordillera



To many travellers, North Luzon is simply the Cordillera. These spiny mountains, which top out at around 2900m, are beloved, worshipped and feared in equal doses by those who witness them and those who live among them.














Destination


Cebu City



Cebu City is like an entrée-sized Manila; it’s energetic, exciting and fast-paced, or loud, dirty and ruthless, depending on your perspective. On the surface, it does its worst to attract tourists, with its honking jeepneys spluttering exhaust fumes, shopping-mall culture and lack of world-class sights.














Destination


Northern Mindanao



The coastline from Cagayan de Oro to Surigao and the offshore islands off the far northeastern tip is a region apart from the rest of Mindanao. Though largely spared from the violence elsewhere, it’s often inaccurately stigmatised simply by dint of association.














Destination


Boracay



While only 7km tall and 500m wide at its bikini line, tiny Boracay has rapidly become the Philippines' top tourist draw, fueled by explosive growth and a tsunami of hype; in 2013 the readers of Travel &amp; Leisure voted it the second best island destination in the world after Palawan.














Destination


City of Manila (Downtown)



The vast urban sprawl known as Metro Manila is composed of 16 cities, but its heart and soul remains the City of Manila proper (‘downtown’ Manila; population 1.7 million).

















Destination


Southeast Luzon



It’s de rigueur in travel writing to describe a place as shaped like something – Vietnam is an oxbow, Thailand a kite. The crazy coastline of southeast Luzon is shaped like nothing, except maybe a mess. But what a beautiful mess. Between the dagger heights of volcanic Mt Mayon and the leviathan-studded sea depths near Donsol, there’s a lot of variety here.














Destination


Mindoro



Bisected by a virtually impassable mountain range – aptly named the High Rolling Mountains – rugged Mindoro is part tropical paradise, part provincial backwater. Forming a dramatic backdrop almost everywhere, the mountains separate the island’s two provinces: rough and rugged Mindoro Occidental to the west, and more prosperous Mindoro Oriental to the east.














Destination


Around Manila



After the urban joys of Manila have exhausted you, you’ll probably be ready for some fresh air. Believe it or not, it’s in ample supply in the hilly regions surrounding Manila.

The area south of Manila is home to a clutch of interesting military history sights and some of the most dramatic landscapes you’ll find anywhere.
