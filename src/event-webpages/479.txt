This week, on 19 August, we celebrate World Humanitarian Day. The day commemorates our UN colleagues who died in a brutal attack on the UN offices in Baghdad in 2003. It also marks the efforts of other humanitarian workers who have risked their lives – and in some case lost them – in an effort bring relief and assistance to people whose lives are thrown into turmoil because of man-made conflicts and natural disasters. Every year, disasters cause immense suffering to millions of people, and those who suffer most tend to be the poorest, the most marginalized and the most vulnerable.

Bringing water back to typhoon damaged schools

"How can I help my country when I can't even attend school because its facilities are broken down?" reasons Celina, a tenth-grader at the Ramon Arnaldo High School here, when asked why she thinks it is important to mobilize help for schools.

Super Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda) blew away roofs, walls, windows, water pipes, toilets, and much more. It was saddening. "Some of our students cried when they saw what Yolanda did to their school," says Nenita Villa, principal of the Catalino Andrada Memorial School in Ivisa, Capiz. What the typhoon couldn't take away, though, was the students' strong resolve to keep on learning.

﻿
Four teachers from the Kapangian Central School here have made a pledge to ensure that their school is safe as children return this week, and that their pupils are prepared for any emergency.

They made this commitment after recently attending a two-day seminar-workshop on psychosocial support to children, Disaster Risk Reduction and Education in Emergencies. They were among 837 teachers, day-care workers and school staff who recently underwent a training course conducted by UNICEF and partners in the Typhoon Yolanda-affected areas in central Philippines.

Cash grant help families recover from Typhoon Haiyan

Michelle Postrero Lao, 22, lost her six-year-old child when Typhoon Yolanda hit her hometown of Barangay Victoria, Dagami, Leyte province. Currently eight months pregnant with her fourth child, she was injured during the typhoon when a concrete wall damaged her family’s modest hut.

Michelle and her family did not know that Typhoon Yolanda, as Haiyan is known locally, was coming. They did not own a television or radio. The remoteness of her house, located in one of the hardest-hit areas, makes it even more difficult for them.

“I have been promoted to grade four with good grades,” says Janene while holding up her results sheet.  Her sparkling eyes and glowing face reflect her happiness and pride in her achievement. 

Janene Mae Gahi, 10, is a student at Manlurip Elementary School in Tacloban. As she mingles with her friends at their graduation ceremony, Janene seems to be making her way out of the haunting memory of Typhoon Haiyan.

Saturday 8 February marked exactly three months after Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda). On this day, after months of following the relief efforts from a distance at UNICEF’s regional office in Bangkok, I was fortunate to witness the change in Tacloban, one of the hardest hit areas, and talk to people affected by the typhoon.

Typhoon Haiyan: Rebuilding lives, returning to school

UNICEF EAPRO

Edegario, 12, points to where his house used to be.  Two broken wooden poles are all that is left.  His family is now living with his uncle, in the house next door, which was also heavily damaged.  The family repaired it as much as they could with tarpaulin, panel sheets, whatever they could find out of the debris.

Edegario lives in Tacloban neighbourhood heavily affected by Typhoon Haiyan (local name Yolanda).  Three months on, the neighbourhood still bears the signs of massive devastation.  At least most of the few metres high debris has been cleared.

Christina Baguisa is only 4 years old, but she already sings like a professional. Her father Teodoro says she learned to sing from watching TV. Christina sang today in front of 184 children, day care workers and parents at the launch of back to learning in day care centres in areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolanda).

Under the leadership of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) and the Office of the Municipal Mayor, UNICEF and partners are supporting an estimated 80,000 children aged 3 to 4 years old to return to day care centres.

The official reopening of schools is a positive step towards recovery in parts of the Philippines still struggling to cope with the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan.

As the morning sun rises over the ocean, the neighbourhood of San Roque is buzzing with activity. Children are bathing, having breakfast and preparing to go back to school – a big day just two months after Typhoon Haiyan tore across the country.

“Our school had 17 classes,” says Myra Salve, a teacher in San Roque. “Only one was left by the typhoon.”

Typhoon Haiyan: How UNICEF is responding to children’s health needs

Nabila Zaka

I have just back from Tacloban. I am a UNICEF health specialist and travelled there as part of UNICEF’s global support to help colleagues working to restore health systems that protect children in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan (known locally as Yolande).

Even after my return home to Bangkok, I am still awed by the fury of the Typhoon, its massive destruction. I am also struck by the strength and the spirit of the people whose lives it decimated. Among the heaps of debris, there are signs that announce “we will rise again” and “homeless, roofless but not hopeless”.

It's Sunday in Tacloban. Two days ago, while working with journalists on the ground, we visited one of the hardest hit barangays (neighborhoods) of the city. It's a coastal barangay where thousands of people lived in somewhat of a shanty-town, about 200 meters from the ocean's edge.

Immunization in emergencies

Nabila Zaka

By Nabila Zaka, Health Specialist, UNICEF East Asia & Pacific
Survival and well-being of children is our main aim while working in Health sector in UNICEF. When emergencies occur, children are more vulnerable, and immunization campaigns become critically important. One of the first highly contagious diseases to appear in humanitarian situation is measles, outbreak of which have been reported recently in Syria, Pakistan, Nicaragua and Democratic Republic of Congo.
