Kini Schoop, public relations director for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, just returned from the Philippines where she was working with media and collecting stories about UNICEF's effort to aid children and families affected by the storm.












The blue bucket — it's the UNICEF family hygiene kit, and thousands have been distributed across the Philippines in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda).
This video — shot at UNICEF's Manila warehouse — explains what's inside the blue bucket and why it's so essential for displaced families in the Philippines.
