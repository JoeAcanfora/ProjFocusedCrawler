Hospital of Hope in South Sudan
April 9th, 2014
 
                                In the face of war and fleeing refugees, the Samaritan's Purse hospital in Maban has reached capacity. Now we're building additions  to offer healing and hope to the influx of lost people. 

South Sudanese refugees are fleeing their homes due to violence. The needs among these people are great, especially in the area of medical care. Samaritan's Purse is constructing new additions to our hospital near a refugee camp where medical professionals and volunteers will not only help care for hurting people, but also share the healing power and truth behind the Gospel. http://www.samaritanspurse.org

                                Watch as Samaritan's Purse participate in Alaska Shield, a disaster simulation that will help our organization and the state to  be ready to respond when catastrophe strikes.

Volunteers from all over participated in Alaska Shield to help Samaritan's Purse and state emergency management personnel practice their disaster relief response skills that will be needed when disaster strikes. To simulate the disaster, actors wore fake wounds as they let medical and emergency officials at a mobile field hospital practice the procedures they use in high-pressure situations.
