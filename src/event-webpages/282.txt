How Far Can You Walk?
August 26th, 2014
 
                                            Rojelio Rios was forced to walk away to find work to support his family after Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines. Back at home his son, Erwin, was severely malnourished and unable to walk. See the transformation that happens when a father chooses to trust God.
