InterAksyon.comThe online news portal of TV5
TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines – Some of the bunkhouses constructed by the government in Tacloban City were totally destroyed by typhoon Hagupit (local name Ruby) which pummelled Eastern Visayas late Saturday well into Sunday morning.
Children huddle inside the Redemptorist church, one of the temporary evacuation centers.
Some of the bunkhouse dwellers in Barangay Fatima were told in a meeting by their camp manager that those who want to evacuate to a safer place may go but they should be listed, apparently so the authorities have a way of tracking them.“Nagpatawag po ng meeting ang DSWD sa amin, sabi kung sino daw ang gusto mag-evacuate sa safe na lugar, tapos kung may mangyari sa amin wala daw silang pakialam,” resident Eva Postre said.The DSWD personnel allegedly kept them waiting for instructions, and then it was too late: they were told that there was no longer any vacant place where they could transfer because all evacuation centers were filled up.“Sinabi sa amin kung kaya nyo dito, dito nalang kayo. May mga nag-evacuate sa sementeryo nang manalasa na ang bagyo, natatakot kasi sila sa lakas ng hangin [We were told, 'if you can make it here, just stay here.  But some people were scared when the strong winds came, and they sought shelter in the cemetery],” Postre said.
Couple sleeps on the floor of the church
For his part, Benedicto Dablo of Brgy 60-A said they did not evacuate because they were told that if they leave their area, they will not be given relief goods. He stayed in his bunkhouse and ran when the strong storm destroyed his room, almost killing him.“Hindi ako nag-evacuate kasi wala naman akong mapupuntahan. Sabi ng DSWD safe naman daw dito kasi tinali nila at nilagyan ng pampatibay. Noong malakas na ang hangin tumakbo ako sa may simbahan [I did not evacuate because I had nowhere to go, the DSWD said it was safe. They battened it down and put reinforcements. But when the strong winds came, I ran to the church],” Dablo told InterAksyon.com
Dablo's bunkhouse destroyed by typhoon Ruby
Other residents, uncertain of how well the bunkhouses - built simply as transitional homes for families who lost their original homes to typhoon Yolanda in 2013 - could withstand the fury of Hagupit, ran to the cemetery as soon as they felt the impact of typhoon Ruby.“They said we are safe because we are in a safe zone, but it turns out such wasn't the case. Those who were anxious and doubted the assurances ran to the cemetery and hid there," Dablo said, speaking in Filipino. 
Bunkhouses in Brgy. Fatima, Tacloban manifest the fury of Hagupit.
As of Sunday noon, families living in the bunkhouses had not yet received relief packs from DSWD's Regional Office 8.
