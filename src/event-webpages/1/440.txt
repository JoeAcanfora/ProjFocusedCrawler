On Jan. 1, Florida State will be playing for a spot in its second straight national championship game. 
The No. 3-ranked Seminoles are set to take on No. 2 Oregon in the Rose Bowl, with the winner of that contest facing the victor of the other College Football Playoff semifinal game between No. 1 Alabama and No. 4 Ohio State. 
For the contest, Florida State will be wearing new uniforms. Here’s the first look at the actual jersey. Check it out:
