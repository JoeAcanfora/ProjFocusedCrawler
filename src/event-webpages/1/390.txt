A few new additions to this weekly article. First, we will welcome the 25th commitment of the 2014 Seminole recruiting class, 3-star OL/DL commit Arthur Williams of E.E. Smith High School from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Also, we'll start to track 5 star DE Lorenzo Carter for his renewed interest in the Noles since they destroyed Clemson at Death Valley.

Since the Noles' big win at Clemson last Saturday, I expect a lot of recruiting momentum to pick up for the Seminoles. Especially since we are getting closer to November and many recruits are taking their official visits around the country. Expect to see this list change quite a bit over the next few weeks as more news comes in.

As always, if any TN readers get a chance to see any of these games this week, please let us know what you saw in the comments section.
