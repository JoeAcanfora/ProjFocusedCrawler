Report: Jameis Winston Will Be On Florida State’s Sideline Tonight Vs. Clemson
Andrew Holleran

Jameis Winston won’t be playing for Florida State this evening against Clemson. The Seminoles’ Heisman-winning quarterback yelled an obscene phrase on campus Tuesday and reportedly lied about the act to administrators, forcing FSU’s athletic director to increase the initial punishment of a one-half suspension to a full game. 
The redshirt sophomore will reportedly still be on the sideline tonight for his team’s contest against the Tigers. 

I’ve been told that Jameis Winston will be on the field tonight with his team “most importantly to help Sean Maguire” #CLEMvsFSU
— Heather Cox (@heatherespn) September 20, 2014

Making the start in Winston’s absence will be redshirt sophomore Sean Maguire, who has thrown for 28 yards this season in back-up duty. 
Florida State and Clemson are set to kickoff at 8 p.m. E.T. The game will be broadcast on ABC.
