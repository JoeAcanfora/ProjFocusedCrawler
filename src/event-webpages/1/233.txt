Textbooks saved Florida State University student during shooting
by Jen HaydenFollow

19 Comments





Chaos erupted at Florida State University last night:
In a scene of terror and confusion, students at a university library in Florida cowered behind stacks of books and dove under desks as an assailant with a handgun opened fire early Thursday before being killed in a shootout with police, officials said.
At least three Florida State University students were wounded, one critically.

One student who goes by the name "thejasond123" on reddit was posting on the site immediately after the shooting, saying he'd heard shots and saw the gunman fire on another student. The reddit user says he ran for his car and sped away. It was only after he got home that he discovered his backpack and textbooks had taken a bullet:
I'm a student at FSU, I was leaving Strozier when I heard a shot behind me. I turned around and saw the gunman shoot one person who collapsed. I turned and ran to my car before driving off. There were a ton of people stuck in the library when this happened. I went home so I don't have any other details.
Edit: I got home and noticed two of my books were destroyed. They stopped the bullet. I was the initial target of the gunman. I've posted pictures of the bullet, the books, and my backpack. I'm beyond lucky to not have been injured at all. Thank you all for your support, your comments have comforted me.
Edit 2: Just got home from the station. Gave my statement, the police came by around 3:30 a.m. to collect the evidence. There were a bunch of people shaken up at the station, but it looks like everyone is okay. The worst injured guy is in surgery, and after that, hopefully (s)he's in the clear. Also, thank you for the gold, kind stranger. :)

He posted photos showing his books and backpack, see the images and video below the fold.

		





Meanwhile, at least 300 students were trapped in the library while police confronted the gunman. One student captured the scene:


10:05 AM PT: The reddit user has now been identified as Jason Durfess and you can hear an interview about his experience here.

Add keywords that describe this diary.

Tagging tips

?

More Tagging tips:
A tag is a way to search for this diary. If someone is searching for "Barack Obama," is this a diary they'd be trying to find?
Use a person's full name, without any title. Senator Obama may become President Obama, and Michelle Obama might run for office.
If your diary covers an election or elected official, use election tags, which are generally the state abbreviation followed by the office. 
		CA-01 is the first district House seat. CA-Sen covers both senate races. NY-GOV covers the New York governor's race.
Tags do not compound: that is, "education reform" is a completely different tag from "education". A tag like "reform" alone is probably not meaningful.





Consider if one or more of these tags fits your diary: 
	
	Civil Rights, Community, Congress, Culture, Economy, Education, Elections, Energy, Environment, Health Care, International, Labor, Law, Media, Meta, National Security, Science, Transportation, or White House.
	If your diary is specific to a state, consider adding the state 
	(California,
	Texas, etc).
	Keep in mind, though, that there are many wonderful and important diaries
	that don't fit in any of these tags. Don't worry if yours doesn't.

outrage, but the shooter was a graduate of FSU. He was a member of the NM Bar and worked for District Attorney's office in Las Cruces (I don't know whether or not he was a Republican):

So unless you think bar association + university graduate = redneck, the meme does not hold.
Btw, I do share your outrage at the carnage guns are wreaking on our society, but I think we have to admit the problem extends way beyond convenient classifications.

white red-neck gun-nut shooting
We may have our fair share of white gun-totting rednecks in this country, but they aren't responsible for every shooting. They aren't all right-wing, either.
Myron May was a college graduate. He was a lawyer. He was mentally ill. And he was black.
You were wrong on all counts. He was not a redneck. Not a gun nut. Not white. Just a sad statistic in a nation that often allows even people with severe mental and emotional problems to legally purchase and possess semi-automatic weapons.
Police have said that May, 31, a Florida State graduate, was in a paranoia-fueled "state of crisis" when he showed up to the library with a .380 semiautomic pistol, shot three people and was then killed by cops when he would not drop the weapon.
His social media activity revealed that he believed he was a "targeted individual," the term used by people who think the government and shadowy gangs are attacking them with mind control and invisible, remote weapons...
"He told me he just didn't want to go on living like this," Mitchell said. She said that after their initial conversations, she became wary of May, concerned that he might be what she called an "impostor." May continued to try to contact her and left three voicemails between 9:19 p.m. and 9:42 p.m. ET Wednesday, she said.
"I am currently being cooked in my chair. I devised a scheme where I was going to expose this once and for all and I really need you," he said in one of the messages, which was provided to NBC News and authenticated by a relative as May's voice. "I do not want to die in vain."

This is another case of not every gun being equivalent.
If the shooter was using an assault rifle rather than a handgun, that bullet would have gone clean thru.
Every time there is a shooting, somebody trots out false equivalence.
No a knife is not equal to a gun.  No a bolt action rifle is not equal to a semi-auto.  No a handgun is not equal to an assault rifle.

I bet he's glad his books are as thick as they are. That's a pretty extreme form of literary criticism. It reminds me of the scene in The Jerk where a sniper shoots at Steve Martin's character:
Navin R. Johnson: He hates these cans. Stay away from the cans.
It also reminds me we have way too many guns in this country.
