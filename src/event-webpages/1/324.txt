“[Al Qaeda] have inspired people around the world to these really small attacks that involve only one or two people–a small number of arms that can have a devastating impact, as we have seen in France.”Threat of “Lone Wolf” Still Keeping AG Holder Up at Night
By James F. Tracy
On CBS’s Face the Nation today Attorney General Eric Holder stated that the Obama administration will host a summit on February 18 in Washington DC to address “the root causes” of incidents such as this week’s terrorist attacks in Paris. “‘Countering violent extremism’ is what we call it–[so] we can deal with the root causes of what it is that attracts these young men to these really negative ideological groups.”
