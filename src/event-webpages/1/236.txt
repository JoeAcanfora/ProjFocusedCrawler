This is not a surprise to those who have followed recruiting over the years. The 5-star defensive end plays for Seffner (Fla.) Armwood, and Armwood players have not signed with Florida State. Period.
It's yet to be seen if Cowart will take his January 30 official visit to see Florida State. Cowart seems to change his mind daily, so stay tuned.

Only two weeks remain for Florida State before National Signing Day. Can the Seminoles hold on to some key recruits and add four or five?

Tomahawk Nation readers have known that Johnny Frasier, the running back recruit from North Carolina, had what can best be described as a shaky commitment to the Seminoles for months now. FSU will have to fight to hold on to his commitment.

Florida State welcomes seven recruits in for the spring semester. For a team that could lose half of its starters, this is a big win.
