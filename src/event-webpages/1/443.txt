Florida State DB Jalen Ramsey Doesn’t Understand Why The Seminoles Are An Underdog To Oregon
Bill DiFilippo

Florida State is currently a nine point underdog to Oregon in the Rose Bowl, according to Bovada. It is a pretty big line, especially because the Seminoles haven’t lost a game in since 2012.
FSU defensive back Jalen Ramsey is a bit confused as to why his squad is an underdog against Marcus Mariota and the Ducks. In his eyes, the ‘Noles have won 29 games in a row and aren’t afraid of anyone.

FSU DB Jalen Ramsey: “We’re the ones who won 29 in a row. What are we scared of? Why are we the underdog? I don’t really understand that.”

Of course, while past results don’t necessarily mean future success, Ramsey has a point. The Seminoles have taken every team’s best shot since the start of 2013, and they have been able to respond each time with a win. Still, they have not faced a team the caliber of the Ducks this year, which should make for an excellent game.
Florida State and Oregon will square off in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. The national semifinal is scheduled to kick off at 5:00 P.M. on ESPN.
