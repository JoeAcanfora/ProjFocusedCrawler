FSU Shooting: Was Myron May a “Targeted Individual”?

Professor Tracey is not stranger to media criticism and one of the few intellectuals who speak about key issues affecting Americans with great risk to his career and family I might add.
Ph.D James Tracey of Florida Atlantic University Communications Professor.
 
By James F. Tracy
Law enforcement authorities and mainstream US news media are framing the November 20 Florida State University shooting incident as yet another case of a lone nut who regrettably gained access to a firearm.
[Image Credit: GeorgiaNewsday.com]
FSU Police Chief Michael DeLeo intimated May’s mental disorientation by noting to the press that the intellectually-gifted 31-year old attorney was in a “state of crisis.” “It’s clear Mr. May’s sense of being in place in our community,” DeLeo continued, “was not in a normal status” [sic]. For US journalists such statements, coupled with May’s unusual behavior leading up to the shooting are unambiguous: a sudden onset of mentally illness.
But was May in fact mentally ill? According to Derrick Robinson, President of Freedom From Covert Harassment and Surveillance (FFCHS), the United States has a long history of mind control research and techniques, dating at least to the CIA’s MKULTRA and similar programs begun in the early 1950s.
“Basically their aim [has been] to control a human being without the person being aware of their efforts.” An individual can thus be directed to commit any number of acts, including murder and political assassination. “They use drugs, they use electroshock, they use hypnosis, and ultimately electromagnetic energy. That seemed to be what paid off the most for them.”[2] Robinson, an African American and US military veteran, also claims to be a victim of such practices.

May’s personal characteristics and behavior indeed fit the profile of a “targeted individual.” He was single, African American, changed his occupational status and living arrangements frequently over a short period leading up to the November 20 event (perhaps to avoid continued harassment), and was even in contact with FFCHS members for support as he protested what he perceived electronic surveillance and harassment on social media.
On Sept. 7, May called police in Las Cruces, New Mexico, to report that someone had installed a camera in his apartment. As the Miami Herald reports, “He told police he could hear voices coming through the walls, and the voices were talking about him. One evening, for instance, he heard the voices commenting on his actions as he applied lotion after a bubble bath.”[3] According to Las Cruces broadcast journalist Laura Thoren, when May “filed the report police told him to ‘switch apartments.’” Aaron Alexis made similar complaints to police in the weeks leading up to his September 16, 2013 assault on the Navy Yard military base.
In early October May abruptly resigned as an assistant district attorney in New Mexico. Shortly thereafter his ex-girlfriend informed Las Cruces police that May was showing symptoms of a “severe mental disorder” for which he had been hospitalized weeks earlier.
May also had difficulty sleeping, sometimes for four or five nights in a row, and recently without explanation traveled from New Mexico to Colorado.[4]
Finally, Myron May suggested that he was a victim of such practices just five days before he was shot and killed by FSU police. “IS OUR GOVERNMENT VIOLATING ORDINARY CITIZENS’ RIGHTS?” May posted on Facebook alongside a video on mind control. “UNFORTUNATELY THE ANSWER IS YES!”[5]
According to Robinson, the prevailing demographic of an electronic harassment/surveillance victim is a single woman between the ages of 40 and 50 years old, although single men are also desirable targets. “They tend to choose individuals that are alone and unattached to family and friends,” Robinson observes. “They tend to want someone that they can isolate, and if they can get someone by themselves they can really bring the full bearing of their program upon them.”[6]
Through the corporate media lens the fact that many thousands of individuals claim to be routinely subjected to such techniques is far outweighed by the more easily apprehended notion of a mentally unhinged lone gunman running amok. To an American public that remains largely ignorant of electronic harassment and surveillance and oblivious to the US intelligence community’s long history of mind control experimentation such assertions would appear baseless.
Even if journalists and the broader public were inclined toward historical awareness in this regard the idea that the US government and/or government contractors would wield such techniques to harass and manipulate American citizens seems particularly outlandish.
As with the Sandy Hook massacre and the rash of mass shootings since, the mental illness angle to this story will ultimately carry the day, providing further momentum to the gun control lobby and those seeking to make compulsory psychiatric evaluations and psychotropic drugs a routine component of public health.[7]

Other issues addressed by Professor Tracey
It would seem so from the broadcast journalist’s January 11 performance on his CNN program. Once corporate news media have told us what “reality” is, no further questioning is allowed, especially from credentialed individuals such as “tenured professors.” One has to ask, “Is this journalism? Or the frustrated defense of a news presenter and an increasingly uncertain storyline?”
Or, “Does Anderson Cooper Want James Tracy and/or His Family Members Harmed?”

Other controversial issues discussed by professor Tracy include Sandy Hook.

Older post concerning Florida State I posted yesterday.

Not the first time tragedy has struck FSU. Ted Bundy murdered some sorority girls there under very suspicious circumstances.
Mass murderer Ted Bundy who supposedly was executed in Florida is said to be possibly the son of McGeorge Bundy an American diplomat whose brother was a CIA agent. Bundy The Mass Murderer
McGeorge Bundy was the National Security Supervisor for Kennedy and Johnson. His older brother was a CIA agent. All of McGeorge’s children are not listed on Wiki. The company loves inside jokes and probably felt there was no need to change Ted’s name as Americans are usually oblivious to what is going on around them. To wrap this up quickly, Miles Mathis shows some pretty strong circumstantial evidence that Ted Bundy is the missing fifth son of McGeorge Bundy. You can look at pics on his site and see the resemblance. I am trying to shorten this as much as possible so readers may follow the magic web.
It is interesting that Fritz Springmeier in his “Bloodlines of the Illuminati” identifies the Bundy family as one of the original 13 Illuminati bloodlines. He goes on to lists a who’s who of various Bundys who have occupied positions of authority in commerce and industry and particularly the power structure of the US government and intelligence agencies. He even adduces evidence of the notorious serial rapist and murderer Ted Bundy who actually joined the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1975 and was posthumously baptized in an “endowment” ceremony on May 2008 in the Jordan River Temple in South Jordan, a suburb 16 mile south of Salt Lake City Utah in an eldritch ritual the likes of which could only be encountered in the halls of Mormon. In the following linked video many similar questions are raised as to the role the Illuminati are playing in this theater of the absurd in Nevada which has all the makings of a classic intelligence agency psychological operation designed to effect a hidden agenda.

All too true, unfortunately. On the one hand you have MKULTRA. On the other, you have an ignorant public believing their victims are “simply” insane and not mind-controlled. Then you have the poor guy stuck in the middle who would love nothing more than a chance to live a normal, free life. Who are the real criminals here?

I’ve gotten so caught up in the negativity of the world that I’m about to drive myself crazy! Jesus said “I have come that they might have life and have it more abundantly”. When I get my focus off my mission and onto evil people, I get depressed. God never meant for His kids to live that way. The news is full of lies and negativity, because it sells, it’s popular, gets ratings. All I really need to know is that every time they (politicians and “elites”) open their mouths, it’s a guaranteed lie, and it’s NOT for our good, only their twisted egoes and their temporary benefit. God is going to punish evil, that is a guarantee. Their money and their power isn’t going to get them diddly squat when they stand before Him. They need the truth, and they need to be warned of the judgment that is coming. When I have done that, I’m not reponsible for where they end up – they are! Free will can be a dangerous thing. The world as a whole is under satanic deception. Lies, deceit and stealth is the only way evil can win, because if people really knew the truth, they would drag these criminals out and hang them in the public square of every city. But God is a God of grace and patience, not willing that ANY should perish. Because His judgment is slow in coming (His patience), people believe it will never come, but it is coming and already here. Sometimes God gives people the leaders they deserve and want – and that is a form of judgment. That said, we have to go to God His way. Strange thing, all roads DO lead to God, but only one leads to heaven. God says the only way is through Jesus Christ. Those of us who have found Him are not getting there through our own efforts, nothing good about us, except that we have found the “narrow way” that leads to life and followed it. The Apostle Paul started out as a murderer of Christians, but when God knocked him flat on the Damascus road, he became the greatest preacher the world has ever known. My Christmas wish is for peace, but peace is not possible in this satanically-controlled world. Peace comes individually when we get right with the Prince of Peace. Until Jesus returns, this planet is a spiritual battlefield. The battle is going to be played out in wars and isolated acts of aggression, such as this shooting. The source might be mind control, but the ultimate source is satan, who comes for no other reason than to steal, kill and destroy.

 Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution the time will comee when medicine will organize itself into an undercover dictatorship. To restrict the art of healing to doctors and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic. 
Benjamin Rush, Signer of the Declaration of Independence
Destiny comes to those who listen and fate finds the rest. 
Frederick Nietzsche who said (I am paraphrasing) that to get to a semblance of truth, one must start by throwing out everything the theologians want to pass off as truth!
Believe those who are seeking the truth. Doubt those who find it. ~Andre Gide
If you chase two rabbits you will not catch either one. Russian
John Swinton on the Free Press 
One night, probably in 1880, John Swinton, then the preeminent New York journalist, was the guest of honour at a banquet given him by the leaders of his craft. Someone who knew neither the press nor Swinton offered a toast to the independent press. Swinton outraged his colleagues by replying:
“There is no such thing, at this date of the world’s history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it.
There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with.
Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.
The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?
We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.”
I believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and Christianity and candles have been introduced. ~Henry David Thoreau, "Solitude," Walden, 1854
The angels have grown tired of the clever .... Kahlil Gibran
Some people walk in the rain others just get wet.
A member of the Ohiyesa Santee Sioux was asked about the sabbath and he replied that he saw no need to set aside one day a week for God, for an indian all days are God's days. 
“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief.” -Frantz Fanon”
It is much easier to fool someone than to to convince them they have been fooled ... Mark Twain
I usually lump organized religion, organized labor, and organized crime together. The Mafia gets points for having the best restaurants.
Faith is spiritualized imagination
To me faith means not worrying. ~John Dewey
“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.”
Aldous Huxley Brave New World

 



 An Inuit hunter asked the local missionary priest: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?" "No," said the priest, "not if you did not know." "Then why," asked the Inuit earnestly, "did you tell me?" ~Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.
I didn't know I had a quarrel with him. ~Henry Thoreau in answer to the question, "Have you made your peace with God?"
Man is a Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven. ~Mark Twain
Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful. ~Seneca the Younger
The past actually happened but history is only what someone wrote down. ~A. Whitney Brown, The Big Picture
Woe unto the defeated,

 "Beware of the pedant, the man in the ivory tower, who cannot be trusted any more than the rabble of the streets.  Too long cloistered in the halls of academe, the first are dangerous, for they fail to understand the world, and know not reality.

All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.......Nietzsche

“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”
Democracy too is a religion. It is the worship of jackals by jackasses.
“As democracy is perfected, the office of the President represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.”
1920

Our race is the Master Race. We are divine gods on this planet. We are as different from the inferior races as they are from insects. In fact, compared to our race, other races are beasts and animals, cattle at best. Other races are considered as human excrement. Our destiny is to rule over the inferior races. Our earthly kingdom will be ruled by our leader with a rod of iron. The masses will lick our feet and serve us as our slaves."
