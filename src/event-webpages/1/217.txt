Florida State University Shocked By Three Students Wounded By Gunman In Strozier Library

Posted on November 20, 2014 by Dublinsmick  

This is especially sickening for me as it is my alma mater. First there was Theodore Bundy now this.
http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2014/11/20/tpd-investigating-crime-scene-at-dewey-and-call-streets/19311083/
Update 9 a.m.
“Two of the student victims in this morning’s shooting at FSU’s Strozier Library remain in the hospital, one in critical condition, one in good condition, Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare officials said.
A third student injured in the shooting at about 12:30 a.m. at the library was treated at the scene and released, Tallahassee police officials said.
The lone gunman was confronted by officers at the front of the library shortly after shots were reported. Officers with the Tallahassee Police Department and FSU Police Department ordered the man to drop his weapon, but he fired at them instead. Officers returned fire, killing the man, who has not been identified.
FSU classes and exams have been canceled for the day, but the university is open and officials are providing counseling and other services to affected students. More than 300 students were studying in the library when the shootings occurred. Some fled without their shoes.
TPD, which has taken the lead in the investigation has so far held two news conferences. Another is planned for 3 p.m.”
It is not the first time tragedy has struck at FSU. I was a student there during the Ted Bundy murders. This one had a very dark side not many people know about.
Mass murderer Ted Bundy who supposedly was executed in Florida is said to be possibly the son of McGeorge Bundy an American diplomat whose brother was a CIA agent. Bundy The Mass Murderer
http://mileswmathis.com/bundy.pdf
McGeorge Bundy was the National Security Supervisor for Kennedy and Johnson. His older brother was a CIA agent. All of McGeorge’s children are not listed on Wiki. The company loves inside jokes and probably felt there was no need to change Ted’s name as Americans are usually oblivious to what is going on around them. To wrap this up quickly, Miles Mathis shows some pretty strong circumstantial evidence that Ted Bundy is the missing fifth son of McGeorge Bundy. You can look at pics on his site and see the resemblance. I am trying to shorten this as much as possible so readers may follow the magic web.
It is interesting that Fritz Springmeier in his “Bloodlines of the Illuminati” identifies the Bundy family as one of the original 13 Illuminati bloodlines. He goes on to lists a who’s who of various Bundys who have occupied positions of authority in commerce and industry and particularly the power structure of the US government and intelligence agencies. He even adduces evidence of the notorious serial rapist and murderer Ted Bundy who actually joined the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1975 and was posthumously baptized in an “endowment” ceremony on May 2008 in the Jordan River Temple in South Jordan, a suburb 16 mile south of Salt Lake City Utah in an eldritch ritual the likes of which could only be encountered in the halls of Mormon. In the following linked video many similar questions are raised as to the role the Illuminati are playing in this theater of the absurd in Nevada which has all the makings of a classic intelligence agency psychological operation designed to effect a hidden agenda.

It will be very interesting to find out more concerning the background of this shooter.
He was studying and planning to take the Florida Law exam. He was a former counselor at the Taunton Children’s home.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2842011/Gunman-opens-fire-Florida-State-University-library-shooting-two-captured-authorities.html
“Last week he wrote on the Facebook page of the group conspiracy theory group Targeted Individuals International saying: ‘Has anyone ever been encouraged by your handler to kill with a promise of freedom. ‘
However, last month an ex-girlfriend called police on May saying he was harassing her. The woman said May, who was living in Las Cruces, N.M., had developed a severe mental disorder, according to a police report, believing cops were after him, bugging his phone and putting cameras in his car and home.
She said May had been diagnosed with ADHD and was taking prescription medication for it; but the affliction had worsened over the prior few weeks.”
He also posted a video about Remote Neural Monitoring – a technique that involves monitoring someone’s brain from a different location.”
May had also been reported to have worked for the DA in Las Cruces, New Mexico.

The Virginia Tech shooter was also reportedly taking prescription medication.

The cows dry, trees stunted, no more flowers, no more purity, ambition, corruption, the age of Kali, the black time."

 Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution the time will comee when medicine will organize itself into an undercover dictatorship. To restrict the art of healing to doctors and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic. 
Benjamin Rush, Signer of the Declaration of Independence
Destiny comes to those who listen and fate finds the rest. 
Frederick Nietzsche who said (I am paraphrasing) that to get to a semblance of truth, one must start by throwing out everything the theologians want to pass off as truth!
Believe those who are seeking the truth. Doubt those who find it. ~Andre Gide
If you chase two rabbits you will not catch either one. Russian
John Swinton on the Free Press 
One night, probably in 1880, John Swinton, then the preeminent New York journalist, was the guest of honour at a banquet given him by the leaders of his craft. Someone who knew neither the press nor Swinton offered a toast to the independent press. Swinton outraged his colleagues by replying:
“There is no such thing, at this date of the world’s history, in America, as an independent press. You know it and I know it.
There is not one of you who dares to write your honest opinions, and if you did, you know beforehand that it would never appear in print. I am paid weekly for keeping my honest opinion out of the paper I am connected with.
Others of you are paid similar salaries for similar things, and any of you who would be so foolish as to write honest opinions would be out on the streets looking for another job. If I allowed my honest opinions to appear in one issue of my paper, before twenty-four hours my occupation would be gone.
The business of the journalists is to destroy the truth, to lie outright, to pervert, to vilify, to fawn at the feet of mammon, and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread. You know it and I know it, and what folly is this toasting an independent press?
We are the tools and vassals of rich men behind the scenes. We are the jumping jacks, they pull the strings and we dance. Our talents, our possibilities and our lives are all the property of other men. We are intellectual prostitutes.”
I believe that men are generally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung, and Christianity and candles have been introduced. ~Henry David Thoreau, "Solitude," Walden, 1854
The angels have grown tired of the clever .... Kahlil Gibran
Some people walk in the rain others just get wet.
A member of the Ohiyesa Santee Sioux was asked about the sabbath and he replied that he saw no need to set aside one day a week for God, for an indian all days are God's days. 
“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit in with the core belief.” -Frantz Fanon”
It is much easier to fool someone than to to convince them they have been fooled ... Mark Twain
I usually lump organized religion, organized labor, and organized crime together. The Mafia gets points for having the best restaurants.
Faith is spiritualized imagination
To me faith means not worrying. ~John Dewey
“The real hopeless victims of mental illness are to be found among those who appear to be most normal. "Many of them are normal because they are so well adjusted to our mode of existence, because their human voice has been silenced so early in their lives, that they do not even struggle or suffer or develop symptoms as the neurotic does." They are normal not in what may be called the absolute sense of the word; they are normal only in relation to a profoundly abnormal society. Their perfect adjustment to that abnormal society is a measure of their mental sickness. These millions of abnormally normal people, living without fuss in a society to which, if they were fully human beings, they ought not to be adjusted.”
Aldous Huxley Brave New World

 



 An Inuit hunter asked the local missionary priest: "If I did not know about God and sin, would I go to hell?" "No," said the priest, "not if you did not know." "Then why," asked the Inuit earnestly, "did you tell me?" ~Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek.
I didn't know I had a quarrel with him. ~Henry Thoreau in answer to the question, "Have you made your peace with God?"
Man is a Religious Animal. He is the only Religious Animal. He is the only animal that has the True Religion - several of them. He is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isn't straight. He has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brother's path to happiness and heaven. ~Mark Twain
Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful. ~Seneca the Younger
The past actually happened but history is only what someone wrote down. ~A. Whitney Brown, The Big Picture
Woe unto the defeated,
whom history treads
into the dust.
~Arthur Koestler, Darkness at Noon
 "Beware of the pedant, the man in the ivory tower, who cannot be trusted any more than the rabble of the streets.  Too long cloistered in the halls of academe, the first are dangerous, for they fail to understand the world, and know not reality. The second are like a mindless storm, roaring and insatiable, full of rage, and a self righteous and acquisitive passion Cicero
All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.......Nietzsche
He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you....Nietzsche
How good bad music and bad reason sound when one marches against an enemy...Nietzsche
Whatever is done for love always occurs beyond good and evil......Nietzsche
In heaven all the interesting people are missing.....Nietzsche
The kingdom of heaven is a condition of the heart..not something that comes upon the earth or after death.....Nietzsche
We should consider everyday lost which we do not dance at least once.....Nietzsche
Against boredom the gods themselves fight in vain.....Nietzsche
You can see a lot by just looking
Who is more foolish, the child afraid of the dark or the man afraid of the light?

Scriptures: the sacred books of our holy religion, as distinguished from the false and profane writings on which all other faiths are based. ~Ambrose Bierce
The question before the human race is, whether the God of nature shall govern the world by his own laws, or whether priests and kings shall rule it by fictitious miracles? ~John Adams, letter to Thomas Jefferson, 20 June 1815
— H.L. Mencken, The Baltimore Evening Sun, July 26, 1920
“Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.”
Democracy too is a religion. It is the worship of jackals by jackasses.
“As democracy is perfected, the office of the President represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart’s desire at last and the White House will be occupied by a downright fool and complete narcissistic moron.”
1920

Occident: The part of the world lying west (or east) of the Orient.

Our race is the Master Race. We are divine gods on this planet. We are as different from the inferior races as they are from insects. In fact, compared to our race, other races are beasts and animals, cattle at best. Other races are considered as human excrement. Our destiny is to rule over the inferior races. Our earthly kingdom will be ruled by our leader with a rod of iron. The masses will lick our feet and serve us as our slaves."
-Menachem Begin (Israeli Prime Minister, 1977-1983)
