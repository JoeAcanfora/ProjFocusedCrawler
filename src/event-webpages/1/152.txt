"The police came on the intercom and said that there was a gunman in the lobby (see video below), and I think he said two people had been shot," Haywood told ABC News in a text message. "We all waited then the police came back on and said the gunman was in custody and to stay where we were.”From The Independent Florida Alligator:  

This video was taken by an unidentified Florida State University student inside the school's Strozier Library during a shooting in the early morning hours of Thursday, Nov. 20, 2014. The Independent Florida Alligator does not own this video and is working on finding its source.
