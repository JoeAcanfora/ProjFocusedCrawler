ESPN’s College GameDay Is Heading To Tallahassee For Florida State vs. Notre Dame Next Week
Bill DiFilippo

This isn’t a surprise: next week’s College GameDay will broadcast live in Tallahassee, Florida for the matchup between the top-ranked Florida State Seminoles and the No. 6 Notre Dame Fighting Irish. While this was a logical choice for GameDay all season, it makes extra sense after both the Seminoles and the Fighting Irish won this week, meaning it’s a showdown between two undefeated teams that may be ranked in the top five of both polls.

Even if GameDay wasn’t going to show up next week, Tallahassee was going to be the center of the college football universe. Now the top pre-game show in America will be making an appearance, which will make the environment at FSU even crazier.
As for the game, you can watch it on ABC, and it is scheduled to kick off at 8:00 P.M.
