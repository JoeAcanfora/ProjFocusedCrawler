Documents Reveal Officers Eschewed Non-lethal Force After Close-range Encounter with FSU Gunman

By James F. Tracy
Note: Psychiatrist and author Colin A. Ross MD, referenced in the article below, will be a guest on this weekend’s edition of Real Politik.-JFT
Police and forensic reports released this week to MHB by the Tallahassee City Attorney’s Office indicate that five Florida State University and two Tallahassee police officers fired their .40 caliber handguns a total 34 times at 31-year-old FSU alum and Texas attorney Myron May on November 20, 2014. May, whose videotaped suicide note indicates he took up the mantle of mass shooter to draw attention to the plight of “targeted individuals”, was struck nine times, with five of the officers’ bullets hitting him in the rear of his pelvic area and lower extremities. Yet while the police report suggests May was shot just nine times, the autopsy indicates his body was riddled with a total of 24 bullets.

By James F. Tracy
Why do most of the world’s murder-suicides occur in the United States? What does this truly alarming epidemic suggest about US politics, culture, and the country’s immense military-intelligence-media complex? The Murder/Suicide blog takes on the important task of chronicling all homicide / suicide events throughout the world by posting press reports of each incident.

By Lionel
[Professional title deleted]* James Tracy of [deleted]* University and Memory Hole Blog joined me for a conversation on the dread conspiracy theory, the label that shuts down and shuts up without fail. Behold the man who dared to question the official account of Sandy Hook, a man who simply and merely asked questions and then uncured the usual and predictable wrath of a feckless and impuissant mainstream media who don’t take kindly to those who question whether they’re doing their job.
