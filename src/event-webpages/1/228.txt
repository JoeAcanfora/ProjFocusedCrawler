I have limited time to put this together so I'll be brief. FSU again had its players out coaching, and this time it included more enrolled freshmen. The guys FSU signed last class were huge. At one point, I had a laugh with some other writers about how Alex Torres (6'4, 290) looked tiny, but we realized he was standing next to players who are 6'7 (Rick Leonard, Roderick Johnson) and 6'8 (Brock Ruble).
FSU's camp is absolutely ridiculously loaded. I don't think any school in the country will bring in more talent over a three-day period than this week in Tallahassee (OK, maybe Alabama).





QB
Quarterback was all about underclassmen Wednesday.
The No. 1 dual-threat QB of 2016 (Malik Henry, of California) and the No. 1 pro-style QB (Jacob Eason, of Washington), were in attendance. Neither worked out, but bother were shown around and received considerable attention from coaches. Henry is a bit thicker than when I saw him in Los Angeles in January, and Eason is a very big kid. Their throwing will be the highlight of Thursday's session. How about that -- the No. 1 QBs at both spots at the same camp at the same time.
QB Dwayne Haskins has already left campus after his visit Tuesday. I'll catch up with him for an interview next week, if possible.
QB Jake Zembiec, of New York, looked pretty good and it's easy to see why he has double-digit offers. I spoke with his dad for a bit. FSU has not offered at this point. I also liked Matt Dame, of Suncoast, and Avery McCall. FSU has not offered either player.
RB
I didn't spot anyone who stood out as an FSU-quality running back. Of course, there is a chance I would have missed someone.





WR
Surprise! Pompano Beach (Fla.) Monarch Alabama commits Calvin Ridley (five-star) and Shawn Burgess-Becker (four-star, who I like at safety better) both showed up. FSU continues to recruit the pair hard, and it's a good sign for Seminoles fans that they made the trip. Neither worked out, but they did hang out with the coaches and FSU freshman receiver Travis Rudolph.
Underclassmen: Tavares (T.J.) Chase looked very good and I expect FSU to offer at the end of his multiple-day stay. Remember,¬†Chase is a big-time talent and a big FSU fan. And Drake Davis, a Louisiana kid who has transferred to a military academy in Virginia, looked great at 6'4, 210. Again, I would expect FSU to offer Davis at the end of his performance, as Alabama recently pulled the trigger.
TE
I didn't spot anyone who stood out as an FSU-quality tight end. Of course, there is a chance I would have missed someone.
OL
FSU commit David Robbins is in town with his father. An interesting note on him is that he doesn't turn 18 until next June. He is a tough player at guard or center and I expect him to work out tomorrow.
FSU target Christian Pellage continues to get bigger. It is crazy to think that the Brooksville (Fla.) Nature Coast product was once 230 pounds. Pellage will be working with coach Trickett for all three days, I believe. I try to catch up with prospects on the day they leave so they're discussing the biggest possible sample set of visit experience.

Washington (D.C.) Friendship Academy lineman Quarvez Boulware, who I don't think holds an FSU offer, looked good as well. I interviewed Boulware and will have that tomorrow on SB Nation.
DC-area OL Matt Burrell, who some have listed as a tackle but who I think is a guard, is also in town for three days. He was hanging out with Jimbo Fisher, and the four-star has great size (FSU offered very early).
Colton Sander, of Oviedo, isn't necessarily an FSU-quality player, but he had a nice day and has good size. Some D1 program should get a good one.
Stewart Reese, of Ft. Pierce, is a 2016 offensive lineman I'll be watching. He's huge at 6'6, 315+.
DL
I didn't spot anyone who stood out as an FSU-quality defensive lineman. Of course, there is a chance I would have missed someone.
LB
I didn't spot anyone who stood out as an FSU-quality linebacker. Of course, there is a chance I would have missed someone.
DB
FSU commitment A.J. Westbrook worked mostly at safety, but I didn't get to see him all that much and will reserve stating any opinion until I see his Thursday and Friday performance (sample set issue).
Four-star safety Jaquan Johnson was also at the camp. Texas CB Holton Hill came and has already exited campus. Ryan Pulley, of Cape Coral (Fla.) Island Coast had a pretty nice day and it's easy to see why Michigan State is so high on him.
Underclassmen: Trayvon Mullen, of Coconut Creek, looked quite good and has the height FSU likes at corner. His teammate, Malek Young, also had a nice day but is not nearly as big. I'd expect Mullen to get an offer, but am less sure about Young.
I spotted J.J. Givens in the stretch lines, but didn't get to see much of him during the camp. Virginia Tech offered Givens recently.
Overall
FSU had some nice visitors that I didn't expect (Ridley, Burgess-Becker, Boulware), and so far, they don't seem to have any disappointing cancellations. I'll take your questions in the comment section, as will Dustin Tackett, who helped me compile this report.
