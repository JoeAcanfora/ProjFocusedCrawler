Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports



Week 6 was a busy and successful day for many former FSU players. Antone Smith scored another long, and pesky touchdown for 41 yards, and Kelvin Benjamin got back on track with a TD. Defensive wise, Lawrence Timmons and Nigel Bradham continue to dominate, with both recording double digit tackles. Graham Gano also kicked a 44 yard field goal on the road as time expired, to send the game into OT, where he would kick another en route to a tie (Who doesnt love ties?) Here is the complete list of former FSU football players, with their statistics for Week 6 of the NFL season.
