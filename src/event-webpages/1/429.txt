N.C. State Coach Dave Doeren Apologizes For Accusing That Florida State Players Faked Injuries Against The Wolfpack
Bill DiFilippo

After Saturday’s game against Florida State, N.C. State coach Dave Doeren made a serious accusation: that Seminoles players faked injuries to slow down the tempo of the game during the team’s 56-41 win over the Wolfpack. FSU coach Jimbo Fisher fired back at Doeren on Monday, saying that N.C. State’s coach doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
Today, Doeren apologized to Florida State players, coaches, and fans for the accusation.

Dave Doeren: “I have apologized to Jimbo Fisher & want to apologize to his staff, players & #FSU fans for my comments..”

Hopefully both squads can move past this, because it’s usually dangerous to accuse a team of faking injuries.
