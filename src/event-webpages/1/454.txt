SDS Puts Out PSA To Implore Fans To Root For Florida Over Florida State
Matt Lombardi

A year ago, the majority of college football fans around the country were hoping that Jameis Winston’s Florida State Seminoles would be able to break the SEC’s ridiculous seven-year title streak. Fast forward to November 2014, and things have changed drastically. The combination of a two-year undefeated streak and the team’s numerous off-the-field issues has sufficiently turned them into the most hated team in America.
Saturday Down South put together a public service announcement imploring fans to root for Florida against the Seminoles this weekend. It’s clearly a spoof, but the sentiment matches what most college football fans are feeling at the moment.

Florida, despite another subpar season, still has the talent to compete with FSU. An upset would be quite the send-off for head coach Will Muschamp. It would also make the SDS team very happy, apparently.
