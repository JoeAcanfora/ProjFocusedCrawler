By far, De'Andre Johnson has been the most consistent Florida State recruit. Every week, he has put up insane numbers in leading First Coast to the playoffs. This week, the insane numbers didnt stop, but First Coast came up short, losing to Apopka, 64-48. Johnson's numbers were some of his career best, throwing for 386 yards and¬†7 touchdowns in the defeat. Of those 7 touchdown passes, 3 of those went to DJ Matthews. Johnson finished with 131 career TD passes.
Johnny Frasier saw his season come to an end also, as Princeton lost to 1A top ranked Wallace-Rose Hill, 42-20. Frasier was held to just 66 yards rushing on 20 carries as Wallace-Rose Hill's defense was suffocating. Frasier did add an 8 yard touchdown run.





Tarvarus McFadden and American Heritage kept rolling, beating Island Coast, 56-8. McFadden returned an interception 50 yards for a touchdown in the win.
George Campbell and East Lake defeated Ft. Myers, 20-7. Campbell had 105 yards receiving and 120 all purpose yards. He also added a touchdown reception in the game.
At this time, there are no other specific stats for any recruits. If you know of any or were at any of the games and want to share some information, feel free to let us know in the comments section.
