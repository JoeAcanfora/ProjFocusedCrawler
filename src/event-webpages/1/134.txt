Jacques Patrick and Timber Creek defeated East River 55-42. It was a special night for Patrick as he passed 6,000 career rushing yards. He ended the night with over 300 rushing yards and scored 5 touchdowns.
DeAndre Johnson and First Coast kept rolling with a 62-7 victory over Raines. Johnson threw for 396 yards, had 4 passing touchdowns and rushed for 2 more.





Johnny Frasier and Princeton routed North Johnston 54-0 on Thursday night. Frasier rushed for 150 yards on just 11 carries. Johnny ended the night with 4 touchdowns.
Keith Gavin and Wakulla crushed Marianna 47-20. Gavin caught a 48 yard Touchdown, a 49 yard touchdown and a 29 yard touchdown.
Deondre Francois and IMG Academy destroyed Dillard 60-0. Francois was 15/24 with 204 passing yards and 4 touchdowns.
Tyrek Cole and Miramar won easily over Plantation 42-0. Cole returned a kick 68 yards for a touchdown.
Auden Tate and Wharton escaped late over Freedom. Tate played on both offense and defense and had an interception on Freedom's last drive to help preserve the win.





There were several players out for various reasons tonight.
CeCe Jefferson left his game with an arm/ shoulder injury.
Derwin James did not play due to an illness
Nyqwan Murray was out due to a violation of team rules. He is expected back next week.
Kai Locksley sat out due to his hamstring.
 
There were no other specific stats for any of the other recruits. If you know of any or were at any of the games and want to give some input, we welcome them in the comments.
