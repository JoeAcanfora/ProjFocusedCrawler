Florida State vs. NC State – Game Time, TV Schedule, Line, Preview, Predictions
Andrew Holleran

Winston will be back Saturday.
Florida State’s life without its starting, Heisman-winning quarterback will be short lived. Jameis Winston, after missing the Clemson game this past weekend due to a suspension, will be back on the field this weekend.       
The Seminoles, coming off an overtime victory against the Tigers, face North Carolina State in Raleigh, N.C. this Saturday. Florida State, 3-0 this season, is ranked No. 1 in the country. The Wolfpack, meanwhile, are 4-0, winning their last two contests in blowout fashion. 
Date: Saturday, Sept. 27, 2014
Game time: 3:30 p.m. E.T. 
TV Channel: ABC/ESPN
Location: Carter-Finley Stadium, Raleigh, N.C.
Betting line: FSU -19.5 (via Atlantis)
Prediction: North Carolina State is undefeated so far this season, but the Wolfpack really haven’t played anyone of note, their best win coming against South Florida. Florida State will be, by far, the most talented squad NC State faces this season, and the Wolfpack won’t be undefeated after Saturday. 
Winston will be back and FSU’s offense, averaging 319 yards through the air this season, should thrive against a Wolfpack defense that is only giving up 18.5 points per game. It might take some time for Florida State to get rolling, but once it does, this won’t be close. Expect Jimbo Fisher’s squad to cover the spread.
