Video: ABC’s Florida State-Oklahoma State Cowboys Classic Teaser Is Fantastic
Dan Lyons

Week one of the college football season is upon us, and it features a number of fantastic match-ups. National champion Florida State’s opener against Oklahoma State in the Cowboys Classic at AT&T Stadium in North Texas is definitely high on the list, and ABC has dropped a fantastic 30-second commercial spot hyping the game, as if hype wasn’t already through the roof.
 
The art direction really makes this spot stand out. There are only a few days left until Jameis Winston and company get back on the field, but we’re chomping at the bit for more football.
