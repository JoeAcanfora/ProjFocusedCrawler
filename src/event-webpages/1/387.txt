Thursday featured one of the best days ever at the Jimbo Fisher camp in terms of top prospects. Let's review who made it out for the offensive side of the ball. Please note that even though Dustin Tackett and I tried to make our rounds, there was so much talent out there that we are sure to have missed some good players.
QB
The quarterbacks were the story of Thursday.





Malik Henry, of California, was probably the best player who has worked out so far at the camp. He holds 10+ offers for a reason, and has an excellent arm, both in terms of strength and accuracy. Jimbo Fisher watched a lot of his reps and it is easy to see why many consider him the top QB in the country for 2016 (I think it is too early for such a designation, personally).
Jacob Eason, of Washington, was also impressive, though I did not find his arm quite as strong as I expected given how big the 2016 prospect is. He does have excellent touch, however.

Top QB target for the 2015 class, Deondre Francois, of IMG Academy in Bradenton also threw and again showed off one of the biggest arms in the country. Full interview with him here from Dustin Tackett. I like FSU's chances there when he decides in late July. Orlando-area prospects Nyquan Murray and Derwin James, both FSU commits, were in his ear.





FSU commit De'Andre Johnson (Jacksonville First Coast) threw a bit as well.
RB
Top RB target Jacques Patrick, of Orlando, was hanging out with current Florida State players (including Karlos Williams), and I'd be shocked if he doesn't end up in Tallahassee. This confidence comes from speaking with Patrick, other recruits and sources. Decision coming October 28 (his brother's birthday). Full interview coming.
WR
FSU commit Nyquan Murray, of Orlando, showed very good ball skills at receiver.
2016 WR Darnell Salomon, of Hialeah (Fla.), did not work out but did visit with other players and recruits and saw the campus. Full interview coming.
Drake Davis was again impressive. I discussed him yesterday and Dustin Tackett has a full interview coming.
2016 Maysoe Wiley, of Cook County Georgia, was also impressive. He is a solid 6'4 and probably just under 200 pounds.
Florida Gators commitment Tristan Payton had a nice day. I'm a fan of the Jacksonville (Fla.) First Coast product. He fights for the football and is a tough player.
2017 WR D.J. Matthews, also of First Coast, actually¬†committed to Florida State Thursday. He's very impressive and is already 6'0 with other offers like Clemson, LSU, etc. Probably a national recruit.
OL
FSU 2015 commit David Robbins had a nice day. The Maryland prospect worked at guard in the morning, and then held his own playing center later on. He came in at 6'4, 290+ with 11" hands and a 7' wing-span. Impressive. Full interview coming.
2015 OL Abdul Bello, of Montverde, looked very athletic, but he is still pretty raw and did not dominate in 1-on-1s. I still think FSU would take him this instant if he wanted in. 6'5, 310 with that athleticism at tackle doesn't come along often. ¬†Full interview coming.
2016 Chidi Okeke-Valentine, of Hialeah (Fla.) Champagnat Catholic, had an excellent day and is rapidly improving.
2015 Jalen Merrick, of New Smyrna Beach, was excellent. He even took some reps at tackle, though I suspect he's going to be a guard -- and a very good one, at the college level.
2015 Christian Pellage, of Brooksville, had a good day, but needs to show more aggressiveness and dominance in my opinion. It's also interesting to see him as he develops and how much muscle he can put on in the lower half.
2016 Christion Gainer, of Panama City (Fla.) Bay High School, is a name to watch.
2016 guard Terrance Davis, of Dematha Catholic (DC area), earned an offer with his performance.
2016 OL Stewart Reese, of Ft. Pierce, claims an FSU offer. He is too heavy right now at 330+ pounds, but I am encouraged by what he can do at that size. As he matures, he is a player to watch.
2015 OL Matt Burrell again hung out on the sidelines and chatted with players. I would really have liked to see the D.C.-area prospect work out, but perhaps he will Friday for the final session.
Questions? The defensive review will be out Friday
