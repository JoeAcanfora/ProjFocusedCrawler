Let's take another look at some high school football results and schedules for this week. I've added a new addition to the targets section in Malachi Dupre. There has been a lot of chatter recently that Jameis Winston's play has really caught his attention and increased his interest in joining the Seminoles. It would certainly be huge and difficult seeing as LSU very rarely lets elite in-state talent actually leave the state. Here's the results and upcoming schedules.
Commits


LB Kain Daub and DE Blake McClain of Sandalwood (Jacksonville, FL) easily beat Jackson (Jacksonville, FL) by a score of 48-7. Sandalwood was on a bye week for 10/4. On 10/11 Sandalwood will be hosting Atlantic Coast (Jacksonville, FL) at 7 PM.
WR Markell Pack of Purvis (MS) helped his squad cruise by Perry Central (New Augusta, MS) by a score of 48-12. Pack had 3 rushing touchdowns on 5 carries and racked up 77 rushing yards. He also had 107 reception yards on 3 catches and added another reception TD. He also had an interception on defense! The kid is definitely talented. Purvis lost to Columbia (MS) by a score of 14-34 on 10/4. Purvis will be traveling to take on North Pike (Ethan Frith's team) on 10/11.
LB Jacob Pugh and LS Stephen Gabbard of Godby (Tallahassee, FL) helped put the beat down on Wakulla (Crawfordville, FL) by a score of 53-12. Pugh Anchored a defense that stopped 2016 QB recruit Felipe Franks (kid is going to be an absolute stud). Pugh had 3 tackles and a QB hurry. Godby will be hosting Trinity Christian (Tallahassee, FL) at Gene Cox Stadium on Friday night at 7 PM.
DT Dexter Wideman of Saluda (SC) was on the losing side in a contest against Chapman (SC) by a score of 24-28. Saluda lost to Newberry (SC) on 10/4 by a score of 13-31. Saluda will be traveling to take on Mid-Carolina (Prosperity, SC) on 10/11.
