Report: Florida State Has Postponed Jameis Winston’s Student Conduct Hearing To Dec. 1
Andrew Holleran

Florida State’s investigative hearing centered on an alleged sexual assault involving quarterback Jameis Winston has been delayed until Dec. 1, according to multiple reports. 
The hearing, originally scheduled for the week of Nov. 17, will attempt to find out if the Heisman-winning Seminole violated the student conduct code.  

I’m told #FSU conduct hearing on Jameis Winston has been moved to Dec. 1.

The hearing was postponed following a conference call this afternoon, according to USA Today’s Rachel Axon. 
David Cornwell, Winston’s attorney, sent a letter to the former FSU female student who said Winston raped her, and the school, on Nov. 6, requesting a delay. The female student first reported the allegation to campus police on Dec. 7, 2012. 

Once hearing is completed, FSU code of conduct allows for 10 class/exam days before decision is due.

Because of winter break, if the hearing concluded on Dec. 5 any decision would not be due until Jan. 13.

This means that it is likely that no decision will be made until Florida State’s season is over. The College Football Playoff’s championship game is Jan. 12, 2015. The Seminoles are ranked No. 3 in the selection committee’s most recent rankings, which were released Tuesday night.
