        COMMENTEMAILMOREThose who knew Myron May, the identified Florida State campus shooter, say he struggled with a mental health disorder.May, 31, was killed by police early Thursday after he refused to surrender and drop his weapon outside Strozier Library, TPD Chief Michael DeLeo said.Keith Jones, an educator in Kansas, was roommates with May as Jones attended Florida A&M University and May attended FSU. Jones said May was taking medication that made the Florida State and Texas Tech Law School alumnus "paranoid."Police in New Mexico — where May practiced law after quitting a job in Texas — also said May thought he was being followed and watched by law enforcement."He was really smart and extremely hard working," Jones said. "There is more to his mental health (status) that may have caused some of this. He was taking medications which caused paranoia. He used to see a therapist on a regular basis. He thought people were spying on him."Jones said May had moved to New Mexico,  had a girlfriend and seemed to be doing OK. May worked as a prosecutor with the State Attorney's Office, District 3, in New Mexico before moving back to Gulf County about three weeks ago, Jones said."But he quit his job, he left his girlfriend and moved to Wewahitchka just a few weeks ago where his grandmother lived," Jones said.Jones said that friends knew of May's mental health struggles, but didn't intervene because he didn't appear to be a danger to himself or others."What he did was absolutely terrible," Jones said of the shooting. "He never had a gun in the 20 years that I've known him. He hadn't shown that he was a danger to (his girlfriend) or to himself. This guy didn't come there (to FSU) to be malicious. He wasn't in his right mind to shoot those people and then leave, knowing police would kill him."Run-ins with policeOfficials with the Las Cruces Police Department in New Mexico provided the Tallahassee Democrat with two separate incident reports that say May thought he was being watched.An Oct. 7 report indicates May went to his ex-girlfriend's house and told her he thought police were bugging his phone and placing cameras in his home and car.The ex-girlfriend told police May handed her a piece of his car and said she should keep it because it was a camera the police had put in his vehicle. He then left her house.She also told police May had been diagnosed with ADHD and was using prescription medication to manage the condition, according to the police report. She and May had been dating for 15 months before the relationship ended.She told police May's mental disorder "has been steadily progressing for the last several weeks and within the last couple of days it had gotten bad," according to the report.The report also says May was taken to the Mesilla Valley Hospital for a mental-health evaluation.May's ex-girlfriend said there was no assault or battery at the time of the incident and that she did not need a protection order. Police tried to make contact with May but did not find him at his residence.An earlier report, from Sept. 7, indicates May told a police officer he could hear voices coming through the walls and that he thought there was a camera located inside his house.Before the shootingAbigail Taunton, who runs the Taunton Family Children's Home in Wewahitchka, said she loaned a house on her property to May after he moved back and was trying to "help him get back on his feet."Taunton said even though May was in the process of filing for bankruptcy, there was "no indication he could do something like this" and that she was "devastated." May ran cross country with Taunton's sons at Wewahitchka High, she said.She said she and her husband gave May a familiar place to stay while he studied for the Florida Bar. May received his law degree from Texas Tech and was licensed to practice law in Texas in 2009."He was a little down," Taunton said about May's mood."He had some financial problems," she said. "Just going from a big law job to a smaller law job. I don't know. We were trying to encourage him. We thought he was doing better and feeling better about himself. We're just in shock like everybody else. This is just crazy."Jones said he and May have stayed in touch regularly and that the two talked on Sunday. They discussed Jones' family and kids. He said that while May had some issues, there was no indication of anything that would lead up to Thursday's shooting."This guy was making $160,000 to $170,000 with a law firm in Houston before moving to New Mexico," Jones said.Taunton said May did not work for her at the Taunton Family Children's Home and did not know why May listed himself as "In-house Legal Counsel" for the home on his Facebook page. Taunton posted to the Taunton Family Children's Home Facebook page to say she was "heartbroken.""He went to Tallahassee last Sunday," she told the Tallahassee Democrat. "He didn't say anything to us, just sent a note saying he needed to get away for a few days, that he was fine and he would be back soon. We were just loaning our house. He didn't have to answer to us."David Taunton said  he had no idea May was in possession of a gun. On a recent camping trip, May showed no interest when others were shooting targets in the woods, he said."He didn't have anything against anybody at FSU," he said while sitting at a large rectangular wood table in the kitchen of the group home, which houses girls ages 8 to 18. "This was a random thing, nothing against those poor victims. He was proud of FSU. They had been good to him.""It was something that he was driven to do in some unexplainable way," he added. "Although I do have some insight having talked to him in length, but even there I'm still in shock and totally devastated and surprised by what has happened."On Nov. 15, May posted scripture to his Facebook page. Many of his recent posts are Bible quotes:"For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:38-39."Childhood friendsBlake Rish, 31, a lifelong resident of Wewahitchka, was stunned when he heard that May was identified as the gunman.Rish, a former baseball player at Wewahitchka High and a 2002 graduate, knew May in high school, and the two were friends on social media."He's the last person on earth I'd picture doing this – he's absolutely one of the nicest kids you'd ever meet," Rish said.Abigail Taunton said May was a "happy-go-lucky" child when he ran cross country with her sons. May also played basketball in addition to running cross country and track for the Gators."He moved here when he was about 13," she said. "He went to high school with our kids. He trained with our kids."Still in shockCharlene Howard, who now works as a counselor at Florida A&M University, said she was good friends with May when the two were students at FSU and remembers how the bright, energetic student impressed many others with his caring and humble personality."I'm at a loss for words," Howard said. "He was a very giving person. He was all about social justice, giving to the community."Howard said May was active in the FSU branch of the NAACP, the Black Student Union and the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity and its community outreach programs.State Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Fort Walton Beach Republican and Florida State graduate, said on Twitter that May was an FSU student senator in 2002."Shocked that Myron May has been identified as the FSU shooter," Gaetz tweeted. "I knew him in undergrad. He was so kind. This is just awful for everyone."TaMaryn Waters, Byron Dobson and Jim Henry contributed to this report.
