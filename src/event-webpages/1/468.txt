Florida State will be debuting its new white away jersey during its primetime contest against Louisville Thursday night. 
The Seminoles, who unveiled new uniforms for the 2014 season, have made some changes to its away set after its new threads were criticized quite heavily by their fan base. Gone are the hard-to-read bright gold numbers – which were technically illegal, because of their similarity to the white base – in are clean, simple garnet numbers. 
Check them out:
