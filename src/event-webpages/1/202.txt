Can FSU land the corner from California? I discussed the possibility in the recent Florida State recruiting update.

Mel Kiper has Jameis Winston at No. 1 in his mock draft




425




  posted by Bud Elliott
    on Jan 15, 2015


go.com

"Analysis: The bottom line is Winston is the most advanced on-field quarterback in the draft, and while the Buccaneers have a nice set of weapons for an emerging quarterback to utilize there's little evidence they have a future franchise quarterback on the current roster. Questions about Winston's maturity and off-field decision-making are more than fair and could have him written off some draft boards if he can't convince teams he can be a franchise leader. But on the field you get a big, durable, mobile, strong-armed talent with a high football IQ and an ability to read, anticipate and process at a very high level what defenses are trying to do. I would not draft with him with the goal of starting him in Week 1 -- his 2014 season proved there's work to be done -- but if Winston realizes his potential, he's a possible superstar."
Kiper didn't have Winston in his top-15 at one point this year.

Nick O'Leary played Rose Bowl with torn hamstring

Nick O'Leary suffered Grade 1 hamstring tear in Rose Bowl warmups. Rehabbing now. Headed to Sr. Bowl next week hoping to play. #FSU‚Äî Tom D'Angelo (@tomdangelo44) January 15, 2015

We knew he was injured pregame, but this may explain all the slipping he did, including when he fell down on the play when Jameis Winston pumped and lost the ball.

Fisher, Meyer, Saban each have won a title in the last 3 years. Here are their records: Fisher 39-3, Meyer, 38-3, Saban 36-5. #FSU‚Äî Tom D'Angelo (@tomdangelo44) January 14, 2015

Also no coincidence that the percentage of blue chips signed is
73% Alabama (best nationally)
68% Ohio State (2nd best nationally)
56% Florida State (7th best nationally)
