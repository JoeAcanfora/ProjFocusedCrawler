People are just drawn to him," said Project Magic adviser Ginger Bryant, a Lake Highland English teacher. "He's the light in a room, but not in a boisterous way. In a humble way."

His is the first name on a plaque of Eagle Scouts in the school's iconic rotunda-topped Rex Building.  "Scouting is the type of thing you can dabble in or drink it all up. Ronny drank it all up," said John Sowinski, who was Scoutmaster for Troop 148 when Ahmed was an Eagle Scout. Ahmed also participated in all three of Scouting's high adventure trips — a mountain climb in New Mexico, sub-zero camping in Minnesota and kayaking in the Florida Keys, an achievement known as the "Triple Crown."Sowinski said Ahmed would carry the items other people could not. "He ended up carrying 50, 60 pounds."Ellery Gainza, who graduated with Ahmed in 2011, called him a "life of the party kind of person.""He had one of those 'no fear' attitudes. He would be the first to try anything," she said. That included teaching himself to breathe fire, throw fire and set his pants on fire.

Al Sharpton will be coming to FSU shortly, as soon as he is finished leading the rioters and looters in Ferguson. Why isn't he pontificating about a black man shooting white people? Racist hypocrite Sharpton. I hope the victim in this case recovers as best as possible. This is a true...

He mastered the skill by practicing fire-breathing techniques from the 1800s in his parents' Apopka garage, Bryant said."Ronny just loved being around people and making them smile. He just enjoyed performing," said David Kahn, a high school friend and fellow Project Magic member. "He was one of the greatest people Project Magic has ever seen."He was also a leader on the band's drum line, carrying the largest bass drum in parades. Once, during a drum battle with rival Bishop Moore Catholic High School, he stepped out of line and blew fire up into the air. "That pushed us over to the winning edge," said band director Chris Greening.During a news conference Monday in Tallahassee, Hana Ahmed said her brother had grown up with a love of science and animals that he carried to FSU.His condition was upgraded from critical to serious, and FSU President John Thrasher said the university is doing what it can to help the family. His sister said Ahmed intends to complete his degree.Polly Peck, a fellow FSU senior who attended Lake Highland Prep with Ahmed, said the university community is rallying around him."He'll be a hero on the FSU campus forever," she said. "He's become part of everybody's daily prayers."Hana Ahmed praised FSU police, whom, she said, likely saved more people from being shot because of their quick reaction — and possibly saved her brother's life.To help during Ahmed's recovery, a fundraising website has been created. YouCaring.com has set a goal of $100,000 to pay medical expenses and long-term care."Ronny was the first student shot, but despite his wounds was able to alert authorities in time for them to subdue his attacker," classmate Chase Roberts wrote on the site.May, an FSU graduate and a lawyer who was struggling with financial and mental-health problems, also shot freshman Elijah Velez of Miramar and FSU alumnus Nathan Scott. Their injuries were not life-threatening.lroth@orlandosentinel.com; shudak@orlandosentinel.com Copyright © 2015, Sun Sentinel
