We can all breathe again. Sheeeeeeeeew why do they have to do these things? It isn't usually easy on the road, though it looked like one of those rare occasions early as the Wolfpack ran out to a 19-point lead in the first half.





NC State's effort at both ends was good for the majority of the first half, and Florida State cooperated both with turnovers and a lot of missed shots. It wasn't until late in the half that the Seminoles found some footing by hitting a few threes in a row, cutting into what had been a 34-15 NC State advantage.
The Pack didn't close out the half well but nonetheless took a 42-30 lead into the break ... which is when a cold spell hit this team hard. NC State managed to score only 10 points over the first 11 minutes or so of the second half, and a good chunk of those points came at the free throw line. Shots that fell in the first half weren't going down, while the Pack compounded things with some sloppy play.
Florida State clawed back in this time, as just about any team with a pulse would, and the Seminoles tied the game at 60 with four minutes to go. Fortunately, NC State had a response, as Ralston Turner hit a three to put the Wolfpack back ahead, and after a Montay Brandon layup, Kyle Washington scored off an offensive board to give NC State a 65-62 edge with two minutes left.
Turner would foul out shortly after that, but it didn't end up making a difference. Trevor Lacey scored four critical points in the last 90 seconds, including an absolute dagger of a shot with about 30 seconds left to extend the lead to six.
That'd be plenty--FSU didn't have a miracle in it. After the game was tied 60-60, NC State closed out on a 12-3 run. The Pack returns home with a much-needed victory after the tough loss to UNC on Wednesday; it's a win that keeps a demerit off the NCAA resume and also keeps the team above .500 in league play.
