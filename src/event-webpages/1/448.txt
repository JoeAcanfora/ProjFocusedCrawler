The Best Fan-Made Memes From Florida State’s Win Over Florida
Matt Lombardi

The Florida State Seminoles survived yet again this past Saturday, despite four interceptions from star quarterback Jameis Winston against their biggest rival – Florida. It’s the fourth win in the past five contests for FSU against the Gators, and the 28th straight victory overall. 
Since the contest ended, Seminoles fans have been poking fun at fans of their rivals on social media. Here are the best memes we’ve found.
