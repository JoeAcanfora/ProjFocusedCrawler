6'6, 319-pound offensive line recruit Cole Minshew, an FSU commitment, was expected to visit Georgia's "Dawg Night" camp Friday, so it was a bit of a shock when the Douglas (Ga.) Coffee County star walked through the gates at Florida State camp late Thursday night -- particularly because he already visited for the June session.
I had a short conversation with Minshew after the session.
Tomahawk Nation: Hey Cole, are you still visiting UGA Friday for Dawg Night? And if not, is UGA still in it for your recruitment?
Minshew: "No sir, I'm not, and no sir, they ain't."
Minshew appears to be done with his recruitment, and that's great news for Florida State because this is a player who has looked better and better each of the four times I have seen him play. He is an enormous, nasty mauler capable of being a great guard or perhaps a right tackle. Previously, there was considerable worry that UGA would be able to flip the Peach-State product.
