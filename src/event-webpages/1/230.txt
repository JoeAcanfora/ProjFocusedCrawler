#6 Maryland vs. #7 North Carolina, 3 p.m. (RSN)
#2 Florida State vs. #3 Virginia, 7 p.m. (RSN)
Sunday, May 25
ACC Championship, 1 p.m. (ESPN2)
RSN Coverage of the 2014 ACC Baseball Championship. All games will also be aired on ESPN3.
In addition, all 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. games will be broadcast via satellite radio on Sirius 220/XM 190. The night games and Sunday's championship game will available on SiriusXM 91.
The Ballpark:
NewBridge Bank Park, Greensboro, North Carolina
X-Factors: Class A ballpark effectsExamining South Atlantic, Midwest League environments


While the Midwest League is a balanced circuit with few extremes, the South Atlantic League has been feast or famine.
Take Greensboro, for example. Since 2010, there have been 593 homers in games the Grasshoppers played at home, but only 299 in their road games. High Desert was the only Minor League team with a greater disparity (369).
The Grasshoppers hit 75 homers in their own yard and 33 on the road. The pitching staff yielded 86 dingers at home and 36 away from NewBridge Bank Park.
At the other end of the spectrum are teams like Lakewood (discussed below) and Savannah. There have been more than twice as many long balls in Sand Gnats' games (352) on the road than at home (172), explaining a home run park factor around .500 in comparison to the rest of the league.

The tournament was played at this park in 2012 and there was an average of 9.2 runs scored over the 13 games including 19 homeruns. Last year in Durham the run scoring wasn't significantly different with 8.5 runs per game in which 14 homeruns were hit. You should expect plenty of scoring because rotations are all out of sorts and teams manage staffs differently in pool play. 
The Weather:
