Florida State Unveils Uniforms It’ll Be Wearing For Rose Bowl Contest
Matt Lombardi

Tuesday morning, Nike unveiled a new set of uniforms for each of the teams in the inaugural College Football Playoff. As you’d imagine, Oregon’s was the most vibrant. Florida State’s, however, doesn’t have many changes.
Per Nike, the team will be wearing uniforms donned earlier this year with a new diamond-colored “Swoosh” on the front of the jersey (to signify the diamond rings the team wants to win). There will also be a baselayer, new gloves and new cleats – here’s more on all of that.

The team will wear a new Nike Pro Combat Hypercool baselayer design incorporating a black Seminole-inspired pattern containing the Tribe’s symbols for Arrow, Man on Horse and Fire, with the helmet spears crossing like the crossed bars of the state flag. The black Nike Vapor Knit Gloves uncover a garnet underlay when stretched, and the diamond-color Nike Vapor Untouchable cleats are highlighted with garnet accents.  

Here are some photos:
