(AP) -- A law enforcement official says a package mailed by a man who shot three people at a Florida State University library was delivered in Texas and is being investigated by the FBI.    Authorities said Friday the package and others mailed by Florida State alumnus Myron May could contain a video and journals. Police officers killed May on Thursday after he shoot two students and a library worker.    The official who confirmed the delivery of the package spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to release the information.    Police obtained a video and journals Thursday and learned May sent messages to friends, telling them to expect a package.    Authorities were expecting more packages to be delivered Friday in several states.    May also has ties to New Mexico.(Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
