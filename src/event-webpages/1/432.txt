Florida State Fans Are Being Brutal To Dalvin Cook On Twitter
Dan Lyons

Florida State fans are not used to losing, and many of them are showing it with the way they’re attacking freshman running back Dalvin Cook on Twitter. Cook, who has been a breakout star for the ‘Noles down the stretch this season, has two fumbles in the Rose Bowl against Oregon, which have helped the Ducks break the game open. Florida State trails 59-20 with 9 minutes left, Oregon is already pulling the starters, and these fans feel that Cook is to blame. 
They’re not being polite about it, either.

Hey @Dalvin_Cook , if Jameis Winston doesn’t leave school with a perfect record, it’s ENTIRELY your fault.

@Dalvin_Cook what school are you going to transfer too?

@Dalvin_Cook that’s your fault right there. Two fumbles. You’re not hungry.

— Ryan Thomas (@ryanthomas04) January 2, 2015


S/o to @Dalvin_Cook for not wanting to win this game. You’re playing good boy, would’a swore you had an Oregon uniform on.

These are some of the more tame posts, too. We hope everyone takes a deep breath after this game is over.
