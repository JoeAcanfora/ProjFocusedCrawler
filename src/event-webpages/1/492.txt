Florida State kicks off its quest to win a second straight national championship in Arlington, Texas this Saturday. Of course, playing a game at a neutral site can be a bit unusual, and anything that will make the team more comfortable in their unfamiliar surroundings will certainly be appreciated. The hotel that the ‘Noles are staying in must have known this, because according to the Florida State football equipment staff’s Twitter account, this greeted the team in the lobby.

It had to have been cool for the players, coaches, and other Florida Staters who are with the team to walk in and see that. The Seminoles will take on Oklahoma State on Saturday night at AT&T Stadium.
