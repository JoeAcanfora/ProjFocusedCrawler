This week did not produce many eye popping results for Florida state recruits as many kids saw their season come to an end.
AJ Westbrook and Mainland fell to Da'Vante Phillips and Miami Central, 31 - 21. Westbrook had an interception in the loss and Phillips was held to 26 yards receiving in the win. Phillips and Central will be playing against Byron Cowart and Armwood for the 6A state title.





George Campbell and East Lake were suffocated by St. Thomas Aquinas, 45-7. Campbell was held without a catch and East Lake's offense only had 19 yards in the first half.
Tarvarus McFadden and Heritage defeated Bishop Moore, 20-17. No specific stats for McFadden as he and American Heritage will play Cedric Wood and Godby for the 5A state title.
DJ Jones and EMCC won their second straight JUCO National Championship, beating Iowa Western, 34-17. EMCC finished the season 12-0 and has won 24 straight games. Jones has been an anchor on their defensive line all season.
Below are a few Season/Career stats and awards.
Jacques Patrick was named the Florida Gatorade player of the year.





George Campbell ended his year with 62 receptions for 880 yards and 12 touchdowns. He had 18 total touchdowns on the year.
Johnny Frasier ended his Senior season with 214 carries for 2,266 yards and 33 touchdowns. He also had 3 touchdown receptions.
De'Andre Johnson ended his career with the following stats:11,697 career passing yards131 career passing touchdowns23 career rushing touchdowns1,091 career rushing yardsOverall win/loss record of 46-5
This is probably the last week of these updates as there will not be enough information available next week to produce an article. We'll try to put up the results of the championship games in one of the daily articles. Thanks for checking this out each week. Florida State has a great class coming in this year. #Tribe15
