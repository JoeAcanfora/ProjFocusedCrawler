Florida State Vs. The Citadel – Game Time, TV Schedule, Line, Predictions
Andrew Holleran

Expect a big day from Jameis Saturday.
Week 1 didn’t necessarily go as planned for Florida State. Sure, the Seminoles began their 2014 campaign with a win, and that’s all that really matters, but Jimbo Fisher’s squad didn’t ook like the country’s No. 1 team and a clear national title favorite. FSU defeated Oklahoma State, 37-31, struggling at times defending the Cowboys’ offense. Mike Gundy’s team went up-and-down the field with relative ease. Last year’s Heisman winner, Jameis Winston, had some issues, too, throwing two interceptions in the first half. He did have this dazzling touchdown run, at least.   
Any issues Florida State had in Week 1 won’t be present this weekend. The Seminoles will have no issues with The Citadel, a team coming off a 31-16 loss to Coastal Carolina. 
Date: Saturday, Sept. 6
Time: 7:30 p.m. E.T.
TV Channel: ESPN3
Location: Doak Campbell Stadium, Tallahassee, Fla. 
Betting line: TBD
Prediction: Florida State doesn’t lose this type of a game. This type of game is rarely a close one for the Seminoles, too. Last season, Florida State beat its two lesser non-conference opponents (Nevada, Bethune-Cookman) by a combined score of 106-13. While the Seminoles lost some of its talent from its national championship team, much has returned. Florida State remains the No. 1 team in the country for a reason. They’re as talented as anyone, and that talent will shine Saturday. A Winston-led team will cover the presumably very large spread.
