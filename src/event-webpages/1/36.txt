        TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREMy tweets were initially a resignation letter. I quickly scanned for books thick enough to take a bullet. I wondered if my aluminum laptop was bulletproof. I imagined using those objects to miraculously save my own life, should the shooter reach the fourth floor of Strozier Library.But as the forced lockdown continued into the morning, while trembling and pacing to the incessant, dull buzz of fire alarms and police sirens, I started planning for the worst. I planned to not make it out of there. And so I tweeted. I live-tweeted a school shooting at Florida State University.At first I didn’t realize I’d survived a school shooting until my friend pointed it out to me. By the time it was over, I wasn’t really thinking of my physical survival. I was thinking of my words surviving in place of me. I knew if I couldn’t make it, at least my tweets could. And those 140 characters or less became my focus.I needed to get the information out; I needed to be useful while I was still there. And because I formerly wrote for both my high school newspaper and Florida State’s student paper, I instinctively became a reporter again, using Twitter as the outlet.I used acronyms and slang to temper the mounting fear. Around midnight, my time line began incredulously with tweets like “Guy at library with gun wtf” and “I’m at library lol” because I was unsure of my source. She was a small girl who walked up from a lower floor and quickly said, “There’s a guy with a gun on the first floor” before darting into the stacks. I didn’t believe her, and I don’t think anyone else did either.We looked at each other, not in plain disbelief, but with skepticism. We were there to study. I had an annotated bibliography due in the morning with a solid zero sources selected. I was gonna be in Stroz for the long haul.And we were. Although the threat was diffused quickly, we were locked down in the library for hours. Police arrived on scene less than five minutes after we got word that there was a gunman. When we heard the sirens and saw the cops with their military-grade guns, we understood that we were in danger.It took police about 30 minutes to settle the scene. They made an announcement over the loudspeaker confirming that, yes, there was a gunman, and yes, someone had been shot. Shortly thereafter, they announced that the victims were being treated and that the gunman was captured. Later we learned that captured actually meant shot and killed.We were calm on the fourth floor. Because the situation was handled so quickly, we didn’t have time to panic. Tallahassee and FSU police announced several times that we had to wait for police to clear each floor and escort us out. As we waited, we talked about our experiences and tried (to no avail) to understand why this was happening to us — and why it was happening at Florida State.One group of kids said they ran up from the second floor to get as far as possible from the site of the shooting. One kid was texting his buddies about rumors of other potential shootings in the area. Kids were calling their parents, their friends. Kids were checking the news to see if anyone had started reporting from the outside. I did my best to report what was happening from the inside. Three students shot, one released on scene, one stable, the last, critical.I was shaking so much it was hard to tweet, but the outpouring of love and support from the Florida State Twitter family, and beyond, helped stabilize me. People kept telling others to refer to my timeline for live updates, so I kept updating. If my tweets helped anyone better understand the situation, it was worth it.People kept tweeting at me, thanking me for the updates and telling me how brave I was. I think I just had a delayed emotional response. On Thursday afternoon after retelling my story to news outlets numerous times and refusing to sleep, I broke. I cried a lot. I kept crying and shaking intermittently. I lost the ability to write a piece that wasn’t just a detached summary of events. I was in Oglesby Union struggling to write this piece, knowing that the only place I wanted to be writing was Strozier.Strozier is a sanctuary for Florida State students. I’ll be damned if the Florida State community is gonna let this tragic incident taint the sanctity of Club Stroz. We are better than that. We are stronger than that. We are Seminoles, and we are FSUnited.Blair Stokes is a senior majoring in public relations and English literature at Florida State University. ​
