After a slow start this season, George Campbell has excelled the past two weeks. For a second straight game, Campbell scored 3 TDs. Campbell had a 28 yard rushing TD, a receiving TD and a 50 yard punt return TD in East Lake's 52-28 victory over Seminole.
Kai Locksley had 3 TD runs and 1 TD pass in Gilman's 69-40 win over Archbishop Spalding.





Da'Vante Phillips caught 2 TD passes in Miami Central's 49-0 beat down of Homestead.
Jacques Patrick dominated another team, this time it was in Timber Creek's 28-21 victory over Winter Park. Patrick ended the night with over 200 rushing yards and rushing TDs of 36 yards and 70 yards.
Derwin James had a punt return TD, showing again how dangerous he is with the ball in his hands. James and Haines City come from behind to defeat Ridge 20-17.
Deandre Johnson and First Coast hang on to beat Mandarin 13-7. Johnson only threw for 84 yards and 1 TD. He also had 2 interceptions and each team had 3 fumbles. Pretty bad weather conditions at this game.
Deondre Francois completed just 3 of 5 passes for 64 yards and a TD pass in IMG Academy's 61-0 blowout of Miami Gardens Pace. IMG scored 4 TDs off of special teams in this game.





Nyqwan Murray was finally held without a TD, but still had 101 receiving yards in Oak Ridge's 16-10 win over Winter Springs.
Keith Gavin was the only bright spot for Wakulla with a 98 yard kickoff return for a TD. Wakulla was crushed 60-21 by Godby.
 
There are no other specific stats for other players. If you know of any or were at any of the games, please drop a message in the comments below.
