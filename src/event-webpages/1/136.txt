DeAndre Johnson's stats for last night's game were as follows: 16/25 for 329 yards and 6 TD passes... in the first half. Johnson was out of his mind, throwing for over 350 yards and 7 TDs in First Coast's 54-17 victory over Atlantic Coast.
Nyqwan Murray with another multi TD night, this time 3 TDs and 200 yards receiving in Oak Ridge's 52-0 stomp of East Ridge.





Johnny Frasier and Princeton were handed their first loss by Kenan, 26-23. Frasier ended with 211 yards and a touchdown on the night.
George Campbell showed why everyone wants him on their team, going for over 100 yards receiving and 3 TDs. East Lake beat Tarpon Springs 24-14.
Kai Locksley had rushing TDs¬†of 4 yds, 1 yd and 18 yds in Gilman's 42-16 win over St. Frances.
Jacques Patrick tweeted out that he went for over 200 yards with 4 TDs in Timber Creek's 49-7 blowout of Olympia.
Keith Gavin was all over the field in Wakulla's 42-0 victory over East Gadsden. Gavin had 3 receiving TDs and 1 TD off of a kick off return.





Deondre Francois had a slow night, only going 4/4 for 34 yards, but his team pulled a major upset with IMG Academy beating St Peter's prep, 36-20.
 
At this time, there are no other specific stats for any other targets or recruits. If you have any updates or were at any of the games and want to provide some insight, let us know in the comment section.
