Oregon Center Says Ohio State Won’t “Quit” Like Florida State Did
Matt Lombardi

Oregon/Grasu
According to at least one Oregon player, Ohio State, the Ducks’ opponent for the College Football Playoff National Championship next Monday, is going to be a tougher opponent than Florida State. Ducks center Hroniss Grasu spoke with USA Today Monday, and dropped a few interesting quotes about both his team’s previous opponent and his team’s upcoming opponent. According to Grasu, the Buckeyes won’t “quit” on plays. He says that Florida State’s players, after “one move”, would quit.

“They’re the most talented defensive line we’ve faced all season long,” he said. “The most talented defense. They’ve got some young guys in there who can really play. They’re just very active.
“They won’t quit on a play. Florida State, they’d stop after one move. These guys, they won’t quit on a play.”

Ohio State, led by sophomore Joey Bosa, certainly has an impressive defensive line, but we’re not sure Seminoles fans are going to take kindly to this quote. That being said, ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit also mentioned FSU’s players quitting towards the end of the contest.
