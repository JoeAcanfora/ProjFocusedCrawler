ESPN’s Chris Fowler: Florida State-Clemson Could Be Considered Bigger Rivalry Than FSU-Miami
Andrew Holleran

In the early-to-mid 2000s, no college football rivalry was bigger than Florida State-Miami. There were the Wide Right and Wide Left games, seven contests featuring two top-15 teams, and ton of memorable moments from 2000-06. 
Since then, the rivalry appears to have decimated a bit. Florida State has won five of the last seven games, and only once since 2006 has the matchup been between two top-15 squads. 
Today, during an interview with reporters, Chris Fowler, the host of ESPN’s “College GameDay,” which will broadcast live from Tallahassee Saturday morning, said that FSU-Clemson could now be considered a bigger rivalry than FSU-Miami. 

ESPN GameDay personalities spoke with media about an hour ago. Some interesting thoughts that I’ll share:

Is Fowler’s point valid? 
Florida State-Clemson has certainly been a “bigger” game nationally over the last five years or so. In each of the last five years, the FSU-Clemson game winner has claimed their ACC divisional title. Last year’s contest featured two top-10 squads and this weekend’s matchup is probably the biggest game on college football’s slate. 
“It’s FSU’s biggest ACC rivalry,” former Clemson coach and current Raycom analyst Tommy Bowden said. “And probably the most significant rivalry in the conference.”
Once -or, if – Miami regains its elite form, though, it’s hard to see the FSU-Clemson rivalry topping FSU-Miami. 
Florida State and Clemson are set to kickoff at 8 p.m. E.T. Saturday. The game will be broadcast on ABC.
