Rashad Greene is one of the best wide receivers in all of college football. Florida State’s star receiver led the Seminoles with 93 catches, 1,306 yards and seven touchdowns this year. Apparently, being that good at football means that you can wear a shirt that features your school logo and your face. Greene posted a picture to his Instagram today in which he was wearing a Rashad Greene t-shirt. Check it out:

This is one of the most interesting t-shirts that we’ve seen. Maybe Florida State fans will be able to purchase them somewhere down the road.
Greene’s Seminoles will take on Oregon in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1, 2015. The game will kick off at 5:00 P.M. EST on ESPN.
