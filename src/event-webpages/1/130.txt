With playoffs getting started, the recaps will start getting shorter as teams are eliminated. I will try and get some season stats as I find them.
Jacques Patrick gave a valiant effort, but his High School career ended with Timber Creek's loss to West Orange, 42-21. Patrick carried the ball 29 times for 220 yards. Patrick accounted for all 3 touchdowns, 2 running TDs and 1 passing TD. He passed 2,500 yards rushing for his senior season and ended his career with 7,922 yards.





Nyqwan Murray and Oak Ridge had their season ended by Fletcher, 33-7. Murray had the lone touchdown in the loss.
De'Andre Johnson and First Coast rolled over DeLand, 34-19. Johnson was his normal self, putting up great numbers. He threw for over 300 yards with 2 touchdown passes and 2 touchdown rushes. One of his favorite targets was DJ Matthews, who ended the night with over 100 yards receiving and 1 touchdown.
Johnny Frasier and Princeton absolutely routed Northampton, 70-48. Frasier rushed for over 100 yards and had touchdown runs of 42 yards and 64 yards.
George Campbell and East Lake shut down Palmetto, 24-3. Campbell took a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, his fifth kick return for a touchdown this season. Campbell has 16 touchdowns in his last 6 games.
Wakulla lost to West Florida, 41-34. No stats for Keith Gavin, his season is now over.





 
As of right now, there are no specific stats for any other players. If you know of any, or were at a game, feel free to share in the comments.
