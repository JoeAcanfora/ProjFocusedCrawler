Week 8 was not the best week for former FSU Seminoles while players who contributed stat wise went a combined 5-12. There were a few bright sides with Antonio Cromartie recording two interceptions and Devonta Freeman who scored his first career NFL touchdown. It was also a good week for former FSU kickers as Sebastian Janikowski and Graham Gano went a combined 5-5 in FG attempts. Here is the weekly list of how former FSU seminoles did in the NFL.
