Florida State defensive tackle Eddie Goldman is leaving Florida State for the   NFL draft, according to¬†Yahoo!'s Rand Getlin.
The 6‚Äô4, 320-pound tackle out of Friendship Collegiate Academy High School has   shown that he can be very finesse, and that he is versatile after playing defensive   end in 2013, to back to his natural position of defensive tackle. Goldman left the field   during the ACC championship game due to an ankle injury, but played in the Rose   Bowl showing that he is once again healthy and will not be a concern by the NFL   teams.





Goldman started 14 games this past season, as well as at least 10 games in each of   the three seasons he has been in Tallahassee. The former 5-star recruit had eight   tackles-for-loss and four sacks to go with a forced fumble. Goldman was named to   the AP second team and the Sport Illustrated first team for his performance last   season. He was dominant at times, and invisible at others.
Scouts describe Goldman as "Big, strong, quick, and disruptive." They say "He has   enough speed to get pressure as a pass-rusher while being very stout at the point of   attack." Goldman is projected to be a late Round 1 to middle Round 2 pick by various draft sites.
