Video: Florida State RB Karlos Williams Talks About How Much He Hates Florida
Bill DiFilippo

Florida State RB Karlos Williams understands how important this week’s rivalry game against Florida is for the Seminoles.
In an interview with Warchant TV, Williams talked about how much he loathes the Gators, and how his hatred of Florida goes back to when he was in elementary school. According to Williams, he grew up an FSU fan, and since everyone in his school’s administration was a Gators fan, he wasn’t allowed to support the ‘Noles. He also has some strong thoughts on the colors blue and orange. Check it out:

It’s really cool to see that Williams appreciates how big the Florida game is every year, and how badly he wants to beat the Gators at home for the first time in his career.
Florida State will host Florida at Doak Campbell Stadium on Saturday. The game is scheduled to kick off at 3:30 P.M. EST on ESPN.
