TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - A gunman opened fire early Thursday at a Florida State University library, sending hundreds of students who had been up all night studying for exams scrambling for cover in the book aisles and barricading themselves in with desks. Three students were wounded before police killed the gunman in a shootout, authorities said.  AN UPDATE IS EXPECTED AT A 3PM NEWS CONFERENCE. WATCH IT HERE: wfts.tv/1jGWUtl  Police and FSU officials called the shooting an "isolated incident," but have not released many details, including how far the suspected gunman made it into Strozier Library. FSU's compact campus is located less than a mile from downtown Tallahassee and the state Capitol."This person just for whatever reason produced a handgun and then began shooting students in the library," FSU Police Chief David Perry said.   The attack started soon after midnight when students inside the multistory library heard about half a dozen gunshots. Students began screaming that someone was shooting at them and flipped over chairs in their race to take cover.  MORE: Social media tells story of FSU campus shooting - http://shar.es/1X7yUT  "I ran for my life," said Allison Kope, a freshman from Cocoa Beach, who was on the library's first floor. "I ran right out the backdoor. My laptop and everything is still in there. It was shock. It was just instinct. You don't think about anything else, you just go."Other students hid in the book aisles and some barricaded themselves in rooms.Sarah Evans, a senior from Miami, said she was inside the library and heard a male student say he had been shot. When she looked at him, he was on the ground with blood spreading on his pants leg.Two of the victims were taken to a local hospital. FSU officials said a third student was only grazed by a bullet and was treated at the scene and released.  MORE: Watch video of the announcement from inside the library - http://shar.es/1X7yUT  Tallahassee and Florida State University police confronted the gunman just outside the library that sits in the middle of the campus and ordered him to drop his handgun, but he fired a shot at them and they unleashed a volley of shots, Tallahassee Police spokesman Dave Northway said.Hours after the shooting, detectives could be seen inspecting the body of the suspected gunman, who was lying face down at the top of an access ramp just outside the library. A gray baseball cap lay near his head.The shooting prompted a campus alert that urged students to take shelter and stay away from doors and windows. After the shooting, FSU officials announced classes would be canceled for Thursday.Daniel Morales, a 19-year-old freshman from Fort Pierce who was in the library during the attack, said that when he first heard someone say "somebody's got a gun. I thought he was joking." But after realizing there was a gunman in the library, Morales and others raced to a back room on the second floor where they barricaded a door with desks.  PARENTS: Do you have children at FSU?  How did you find out?  Email us your story.  Freshman Nikolai Hernandez said he was in his dorm room across from the library when he heard five or six rapid gunshots."It was a consecutive bop, bop, bop, bop, bop," Hernandez said. "It makes me definitely a little bit nervous. I was supposed to be in the library. I had a paper to do and I got a little bit lazy and decided not to do it."Florida State President John Thrasher, who took office earlier this month, said by phone that he was in New York City at the time of the shooting. He said he was scheduled to return to Tallahassee later Thursday.___  	   Message from university President John Thrasher regarding campus shooting:  	    The Florida State University community is extremely saddened by the shootings that took place early this morning at Strozier Library, in the very heart of campus, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all those who have been affected.  		   The three students who have been injured are our highest priority followed by the needs of our greater university community. We will do everything possible to assist with their recovery.  		   Over the past few hours, I have received several briefings from administrators and law enforcement regarding campus safety and security, and they have established that this was an isolated incident. Florida State University and Tallahassee police departments have done an extraordinary job taking quick and decisive action to prevent further tragedy, to secure the scene and to keep campus safe. They have assured me that there is no further threat.  		   We are increasing security measures and providing a strong law enforcement presence on and around campus today. I have


great confidence in the abilities of our local law enforcement agencies to handle this matter.  		   As we try to make sense of what is a senseless incident, the Counseling Center and Employee Assistance will provide counseling and support for FSU faculty, staff and students affected by these events. Should anyone need or desire such services, please contact the center at the Askew Student Life Building or call (850) 644-2003.  		   We will continue to share information with you regarding this matter as it becomes available.  	  ___Associated Press writer Jeff McMurray in Chicago contributed to this report.
