Lorenzo Phillips couldn't wait until his upcoming official visit to pull the trigger and commit to Florida State Tuesday. Phillips, 6'3, 230, will be expected to contend for a starting spot and provide immediate depth at the linebacker position.
Originally from Louisiana, Phillips committed to LSU out of high school, but became academically ineligible and ended up at East Mississippi Junior College. Phillips had offers from Alabama, Texas A&M and a few other major powers, but some backed off as he was unable to enroll for the spring semester.





With the dismissal of Ukeme Eligwe, the transfer of EJ. Levenberry, the torn ACL of Reggie Northrup and the uncertain status of Kain Daub (didn't practice or travel with the team for the Rose Bowl), Florida State is certainly in need of some linebacker depth.
The 6'3, 230 pound Phillips comes equipped with college ready size, and the next step will be for him to qualify academically. The Seminoles now have 22 commitments for the 2015 class, which is currently rated No. 2 nationally behind Alabama. With a strong close, FSU can hold off USC, Auburn and others for the No. 2 ranking.
As you can see in Phillips' film, he is primarily used as a pass rusher off the edge, something he may be able to do at Florida State.
