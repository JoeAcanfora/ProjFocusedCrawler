Jacques Patrick is a beast. He flexed his muscle with 315 rushing yards and 6 TDs in Timber Creek's 42-21 victory over University. Patrick became the tenth player in Florida High School history to pass 7,000 career rushing yards.
DeAndre Johnson and First Coast held off Flagler Palm Coast, 34-30. Johnson ended the night 22/27 for 247 yards passing. He finished with 4 passing TDs and 1 rushing TD.





Deondre Francois and IMG won over Trinity Christian, 28-7. Francois had 120 yards passing and 1 TD.
NyQwan Murray helped lead Oak Ridge to its first district title since 1977. Murray ended the night with 271 yards and 2 TDs in the 34-28 win over East River.
George Campbell and East Lake held on to defeat Countryside 10-8. Campbell caught a 21 yard TD pass in the win.
Da'Vante Phillips and Central cruised past Northwestern, 56-21. Phillips had a 25 yard TD reception.
AJ Westbrook and the Mainland defense smothered New Smyrna, 43-0. Westbrook returned an interception 55 yards for a TD.





Johnny Frasier and Princeton crushed Spring Creek 62-8. Could not find any specific stats, but a reporter on twitter said that Frasier at one point had 2 rushing TDs and 1 TD reception.
At this time, we have no other specific stats for any of the other recruits. If you have any other info, please feel free to share in the comments section.
In other news, it was a big recruiting weekend for the Noles. TomahawkNation posted several articles that you should check out:
