Sh'Mar Kilby-Lane, of Hallandale (Fla.), is one of the top linebackers in the country. The four-star committed to Florida State in June, and visited FSU's camp Thursday.
"It feels great to come back to my future school," Kilby-Lane said. "Checking out everything and see my future teammates, To how things are." Kilby-Lane noted that the recruiting class is coming along and that there will be competition every year.





Florida State is being selective in 2015, taking only two (possibly three) linebackers. What does this mean to Kilby-Lane?
"It means that I‚Äôm a very important person for them. I want to show my special use," Kilby-Lane said.
Before committing to FSU, many expected Kilby-Lane to commit to Ohio State. Are the Buckeyes still after him?
"Sort of. Kind of sort of," Kilby-Lane said, noting that Ohio State is the only other team after him.
Surprisingly, Kilby-Lane said that he was unsure whether he would take an official visit to Ohio State -- a program many speculated was neck and neck with FSU as recently as June, despite his commitment.





Lane has been hampered a bit by a knee injury. What is the update on his status?
"My health, I wouldn‚Äôt say 100-percent," Kilby-Lane said. "Its getting there, I'll play through it. I‚Äôm sure it will be healthy before our first game (vs.) Miramar. Tough game."
Kilby-Lane is focused on getting healthy. He told me that he has been rehabbing from his knee, and did not have surgery. He did not specify the injury.
