Florida State's current class has been putting up record setting numbers all year and one of the most consistent has been quarterback, De'Andre Johnson. All season long, he has been putting up video game like numbers on the field and as a result, this past week he broke the Northeast Florida all-time passing yards record. He is now second in the state in total passing yards after he guided First Coast to a 19-14 victory over Ed White. He ended the night with one of his lower outputs of the year, 213 passing yard and 2 TDs. The record he broke was 10,621 yards.
George Campbell again started his night off early, this time returning a free kick from a safety for a 73 yard touchdown after the first possession. Campbell later added another touchdown catch.





Jacques Patrick made his senior night memorable, scoring his 99th and 100th touchdown. He would add a third touchdown and end his night with over 100 yards rushing. Timber Creek beat Freedom, 42-13.
Nyqwan Murray helped Oak Ridge beat Evans, 36-6. Murray had 5 catches for 90 yards and 2 TDs.
Johnny Frasier's stats have been hard to find as of late, but when I am able to locate them, they are always eye-popping. This week, Frasier led Princeton to a 52-12 victory over Rosewood. He had over 200 rushing yards and 4 TDs.
Kai Locksley and Gilman fell to McDonogh, 21-14. Locksley had 2 touchdown runs, but lost a fumble in overtime.
Deondre Francois and IMG won an odd one over Champagnat, 48-8. Champagnat had a player ejected with 6 minutes left in the second quarter. Their coaches protested and pulled their team off the field and onto the buses. Francois had 2 TD passes in the shortened game.





Tarvarus McFadden and American Heritage crushed Kathleen, 35-13. McFadden had a 53 yard touchdown catch on the opening play and later added a 65 yard touchdown off a punt return.
At this time, there are no other stats for any other recruits. If you know of any or were at any of the games, feel free to give some info in the comments.
