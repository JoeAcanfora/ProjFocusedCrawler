Week 5 brought the emergence of Bryan Stork with his first start with the New England Patriots, as well as Christian Ponder's first start of the season. Lawrence Timmons recorded a high number of tackles yet again, and Antone Smith scored his 4th TD of the season, all from 30+ yards out. Here is how the rest of the former FSU Seminoles did in Week 5
