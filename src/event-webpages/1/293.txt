Florida State has landed a commitment from local running back recruit Jonathan Vickers. Vickers, who also goes by "Jay," is a product of Tallahassee (Fla.) North Florida Christian. Vickers is a consensus three-star prospect, and chose Florida State over Louisville. He also claimed offers from Ole Miss, Clemson, Stanford and Others.
Vickers is a 5'11, 212-pound running back. He has good balance and instincts for a back. He does not have breakaway speed, but ran a 40-yard dash for Florida State during the June session of Jimbo Fisher Camp, and the Seminoles were satisfied with his time. Vickers also is an excellent pass catcher out of the backfield.





 


Tomahawk Nation spoke with Vickers in advance of his TV announcement.
"It's just a great environment, just being with the coaches," Vickers said of his choice.
Vickers has bonded with new running back coach Jay Graham over the last few months, and looks forward to continuing the relationship.
"He's a great guy," Vickers said. "We're trying to get to know each other a little more. He's new to Florida State, I'm new to Florida State, and we'll work together and get a better feel for each other."
In early 2012, Vickers suffered a horrific broken leg injury, sidelining him from the season. That did not deter Florida State from offering the talented product.





"Florida State wasn't heavily recruiting me during my freshman and sophomore year," Vickers said. "We were talking a little bit, but it wasn't serious. When coach Pruitt came, things started to pick up, because he'd been on me when he was at Alabama."
Some have speculated that Vickers would be used some out of the fullback position. Is that what Vickers expects to do?
"They like that I can do it all, run, catch out of the flats, blocking scheme, etc. will be the same," Vickers said.
