Did you know the recent FSU shooting was the 91st school shooting since Newtown? INCOMPREHENSIBLE. It’s time for our country to make a change — NOW! We NEED Congress to pass major gun control legislation, and we (particularly young people and parents) need to demand that from them.
In this episode, I’m sharing with you my plea for effective gun control. What do I think about hunting guns/small-caliber handguns vs. assault weapons? Listen to this episode to find out what this “woman with something to say” has to say. I’m also bringing up the important topic of mental health counseling. Lastly, I’ll be talking about the pending grand jury decision in Ferguson, Missouri. I am sincerely concerned for the safety of people in Ferguson and across our country. We need to have honest conversations with our friends & family and stress they need to be safe in the coming weeks.
