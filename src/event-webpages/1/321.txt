Update 5:55: A second source believes Sunseri will take a job on the Oakland Raiders staff.
The recruiting fallout from this shouldn't be that great. Sunseri's top target, five-star defensive end Josh Sweat, is already enrolled in school. Sunseri was also involved with five-star defensive end Byron Cowart and five-star cornerback Minkah Fitzpatrick, but both are also being recruited by Lawrence Dawsey and Charles Kelly. Sunseri is primarily responsible for the Northeast, which means he was also involved with the recruitment of QB/WR Kai Locksley, who is also being pursued by Texas. Defensive end Shelton Johnson is also being recruited by Sunseri, but is also recruited by others on the staff.





Original: Is Florida State defensive ends coach Sal Sunseri headed to the Oakland Raiders? Here's what we know as of Thursday afternoon: There has been a rumor going around among Florida State insiders that Sunseri is headed for the Raiders. Sunseri has had a long relationship with new Oakland Raiders coach Jack Del Rio, and has pro experience (Carolina Panthers). At this point, nothing has been confirmed as a done deal, and Florida State has not made any announcement.
Adding to the smoke is this¬†tweet sent by Tino Sunseri, Sal's son: "Officially an Oakland Raiders fan! #BlackHole #WestCoastVibes"
Sunseri has been on the Florida State staff since for two years, and prior to that, was at Tennessee, Alabama, the Carolina Panthers, Michigan State, and LSU. Sunseri is 55 and in addition to his role as defensive ends coach, is a good recruiter and assists with game planning and in-game adjustments.
