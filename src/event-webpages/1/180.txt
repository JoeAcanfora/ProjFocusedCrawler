Week 5 ended on a good note with Antone Smith recording another touchdown, as well as Bryan Stork getting his first start at center for the New England Patriots. Also, Antonio Cromartie had three pass deflections in his first game back from an injury. Looking to continue on their hot streak, here are the games in Week 6 that involve former FSU football players.
