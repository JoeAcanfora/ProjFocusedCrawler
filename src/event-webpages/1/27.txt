TALLAHASSEE, FL (RNN) – The person who shot several students on Florida State University's campus early Thursday was identified as a graduate who was also a former prosecutor.Myron May graduated the school before earning his law degree at Texas Tech, according to the Tallahassee police chief."He graduated from FSU in 2005, and he moved to Texas where he attended Texas Tech for law school. He graduated there in 2009," Chief Michael DeLeo said during a news conference.DeLeo said May used a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun and had additional ammunition in his pockets. Police have not confirmed a motive in the shooting.May injured three students at the campus library Thursday morning and was killed by university police after failing to drop his weapon, police said."At approximately 12:30 this morning, FSU PD received a call about an armed suspect near the Strozier Library, and officers were called to the scene," Tallahassee police spokesman David Northway said. "As they were driving to the scene, they were notified an outside victim - an innocent victim, if you will - was also injured as occurrence from the shooter."Northway said, according to the report, they met the suspect outside the library and ordered him to drop his handgun. "The suspect did not comply with the commands and actually shot at one of the officers," he said. "They returned fire and the suspect was killed."Two victims were receiving treatment at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. The third victim was treated at the scene and released. Sarah Evans was inside the library and saw a man who had been shot. She recorded cell phone video of the chaos."You're just not really prepared for something like that," Evans said. "So he just looked so shocked, and I just didn't know what to do. I was just like, 'Oh my gosh, are you OK?' And, you know, we just wanted to get him help, but he was wounded laying on the ground. So that's when we really freaked out."Tallahassee Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum called for people to "unite in collective prayer" for the victims, and he said it was also a traumatic day for everyone on campus."We know that for the Tallahassee community that feels so strongly connected to this university that they will have some impact," Gillum said. "It is one thing to read about these incidents in the newspaper or on the national news, but it's another thing to experience it right here in your very own community."Florida State University had issued an alert telling students to “seek shelter immediately” amid reports of a gunman on campus. Police also said the library had been "packed with students" when the shooting happened, with many studying for final exams. They estimated 300 to 400 people were inside Strozier. Photos posted on Twitter showed a heavy police presence around the library?. Video reportedly taken inside the library shows students huddled in aisle as an announcer says, "There has been a shooting in the library." The announcement told students to call 911 if they knew someone who had been shot.Students in the library at the time of the shooting reported being escorted out safely by police. Copyright 2014 Raycom News Network.
