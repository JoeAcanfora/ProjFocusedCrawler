Photos: Florida State Football’s Renovated Facility Looks Incredible
Andrew Holleran

The Florida State football team is coming off a national championship season. Jimbo Fisher’s program–led by freshman Heisman winner Jameis Winston–went 14-0 in 2013, defeating Auburn in the BCS National Championship Game, the school’s first title since 1999. 
Soon, the Seminoles will be housed in a renovated facility. Mark Robinson, Florida State’s Director of Football Operations, tweeted out pictures of the facility. It looks awesome:

Back in March, when plans for the renovation were released, Robinson talked about the vision Florida State had for its upgrade:
“We wanted it to be unique, we wanted it to be the showcase of this facility….We’re one of the top programs if not the top program in the country, we won a national championship and so we didn’t want to build our locker room off somebody else. We asked this one company what they best locker they’ve designed, and they said that in football, we love the Dallas Cowboys locker room, and in baseball, we love the New York Yankees locker room. So we took the best of both their ideas and put them together in the individual lockers the players are going to use. When they see just the picture of it, they get so excited, so I can’t wait to see them when they see the real thing.”
Florida State opens its 2014 season Aug. 30 in Arlington, Texas against Oklahoma State.
