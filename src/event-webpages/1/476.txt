Brand New AP Poll Released, Florida State No Longer No. 1
Matt Lombardi

FSU is no longer No. 1.
It’s official – we’ve entered a new era of college football. The Mississippi State Bulldogs, after a big home win over No. 2 Auburn, are the No. 1 ranked team in both polls. MSU, which is one of just six schools to still boast an undefeated record, has ripped off three straight victories over squads ranked in the top ten – the first team to do just that since Auburn over 30 years ago. Florida State, the reigning national champion, falls to No. 2.
The Bulldogs’ biggest rival, Ole Miss, sits at No. 3 after handling Texas A&M at Kyle Field. Baylor and Notre Dame check in at No. 4 and No. 5, respectively – effectively mirroring what we saw in the Coaches’ Poll. Auburn fell four spots to No. 6 – one spot ahead of Alabama.
Here’s the entire poll, via the Associated Press:
