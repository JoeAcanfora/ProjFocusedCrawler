Jacques Patrick scored all 4 of Timber Creek's touchdowns in their 28-14 victory over Hagerty. He ended his night with 283 rushing yards. Patrick will be announcing which team he is committing to tomorrow night at 6 PM. FSU and Alabama are believed to be the favorites.
George Campbell and East lake clinched their 4th straight district title, defeating Pinellas Park, 45-17. Campbell was a stud, with 8 catches for 177 yards and 3 TDs. Since starting the season off a little slow (concussion, etc), Campbell has really came on strong these last few weeks.





Johnny Frasier and Princeton crushed North Duplin, 67-30. Frasier rushed for over 200 yards and had 4 touchdowns in the game.
Nyqwan Murray and Oak Ridge win over Lake Howell 28-14. Murray had 2 touchdown catches in the victory.
De'Andre Johnson only played 13 snaps in First Coast's easy route of West Port. He threw for 157 yards and a TD. The win gives First Coast the district title.
Da'Vante Phillips led Miami Central over Carol City, 23-16. Phillips had 5 receptions for 107 yards and a touchdown.
Kai Locksley  and Gilman beat Mount St. Joseph 38-14. Locksley showed off his legs with 2 rushing TDs.





 
At this time, there are no other specific stats for any recruits. If you have any other info, feel free to share in the comments.
An additional reminder, 5-star cornerback, Tarvarus McFadden is set to announce his college decision on October 31st. It is thought to be a Georgia/FSU battle.
