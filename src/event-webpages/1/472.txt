Question About FSU Football Asked At Florida Gubernatorial Debate: “Does FSU Have A Serious Problem?”
Dan Lyons

Everyone has an opinion on Florida State football, and now that hot topic has become part of the state’s heated gubernatorial race between Governor Rick Scott and challenger Charlie Crist, who served as Florida’s governor from 2007-2011. During tonight’s debate, CNN’s Jake Tapper, who is moderating the event, asked a question about whether or not Florida State football has a crime problem.

Here’s an unexpected FSU related question in FL Gov debate. Crist also brought up NFL, said there’s problems there. pic.twitter.com/gDutWKW1Wi

Question about FSU football culture being asked at FL governor’s debate. Basically a question about Jameis.

Crist, an FSU alumnus, says it’s a serious issue but is not unique to FSU.
— Randall. (@JRC_) October 21, 2014


@DTenenbaum Scott said every student should be held to “highest standards” and said if there are allegations need to be reviewed.

It is strange to see college football brought up on this platform, but not completely surprising given the magnitude of Florida State football, and specifically, the ongoing Jameis Winston story, over the last few years.
