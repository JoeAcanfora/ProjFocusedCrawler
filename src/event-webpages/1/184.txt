Week 2 saw the emergence of many former FSU players, mainly on the defensive side. Telvin Smith had 5 tackles and a sack, and Lawrence Simmons recorded 12 tackles. The biggest question however in Week 3 is if Oakland Raider Kicker Sebastian Janikowski will get his first field goal attempt of the season.
