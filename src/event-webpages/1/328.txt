Florida State landed commitment No. 11 of the 2015 class Monday in defensive back A.J. Westbrook, of powerhouse program Daytona (Fla.) Mainland.¬†

Proud to say I Officially committed to Florida State University #FearTheSpear #Noles
‚Äî A-Dub‚ùó (@WestbrookAj) May 19, 2014







Westbrook is a three-star or unrated (as of yet) recruit and Florida State was his first major offer. His commitment comes just a day after Florida State offered him.¬†

"I didn't really say much but after I got off, I was jumping up-and-down," said Westbrook, whose offer from the Seminoles is No. 10 for the Daytona Beach Mainland defensive back.

Florida State is looking to take at least five defensive backs in the class of 2015, and Westbrook is the fourth commitment at the position. At 6'0 and 174 pounds (verified), Florida State will certainly be looking to try him out at cornerback, following the recent trend of college teams to place a premium on size at the cornerback position. He ran a 4.61 40-yard dash and had a 32" vertical jump at a combine in Orlando.¬†
