By GARY FINEOUT
Associated Press
 
TALLAHASSEE - A law enforcement official says the gunman who shot three people at Florida State University before being killed by police was a lawyer who graduated from the school.
The official told The Associated Press that the shooter was Myron May, who graduated from Florida State before attending Texas Tech University’s law school. The official requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release the name.
May was fatally shot early Thursday after he shot three people at the Florida State library. Two are hospitalized and one has been released.
Abigail Taunton told the AP that May had recently been staying at a guest house she owns in a rural area in the Florida Panhandle. She said police interviewed her husband, David, after the shooting.
