The IMG7v7 NFA National Championships in Bradenton featured plenty of talented stars. One of the brightest was a 2016 recruit by the name of Tavares Chase, playing for the East Hillsborough team.
Chase, from Plant City (Fla.) High School, has over 20 offers, Auburn being the most recent, and is widely considered on of the 25 best sophomore receiver recruits nationally. Chase said that he is now 6'2, 180 pounds, and has been adding muscle.





"It feels good to come out here and compete and see what other areas of the state and other states have to offer," Chase said of the competition.
During one game, Chase caught nine passes for East Hillsborough.
"Yes sir, I had to," he added. "Had to ride for my team and do whatever they needed. I don't like to lose, and I go hard every rep."
Chase showed tremendous body control, stop-start quickness, route running and hands in demanding a double team in almost every game.
Despite having 20 offers, Chase wanted to discuss a school from which he does not yet have an offer: Florida State.





"I know I am going to FSU on July 16-18," Chase said. "That's my dream school. FSU is the offer I am really trying to get."
What does Chase specifically like about Florida State?
"I like the way they spread the ball and get it to their playmakers and attack defenses," Chase said. "Coach Dawsey came by my school and told me to come up to camp and hopefully I'll get my offer then,"
With all that praise for Florida State, an early commitment to the Seminoles seems likely if Chase gets his offer in July. But is that so?




"It would be tough, but I have to wait to take all my official visits next year and make sure I make the right choice for me."
Some of those visits could include trips to Clemson, Geirgia and Miami, among others.
Chase has a good connection with two coaches from another ACC school.
"Coach Scott and coach Morris at Clemson," he said. "They want me to come up and see their campus. And they talk to me about their academics and athletics."
SB Nation Recruiting will catch up with Chase again in July.
