A closer look at Notre Dame's pass¬†defense






110




  posted by Bud Elliott
    on Oct 13, 2014





Notre Dame is allowing a QB rating of 112 against Power 5 opponents, good for No. 24 in the country. 
But as we see from this chart, those opponents have only posted a QB Rating of 114 against other Power 5 teams. The takeaway? The passing offenses faced by Notre Dame so far have not been very good. This has not been adjusted for garbage time, of which there has been some.
Much more to come this week.
