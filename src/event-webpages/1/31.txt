Comcast uses Game of Thrones to promote customer serviceFree access to MyPalmBeachPost for Post subscribers. ExploreWSB-TV reported Thursday that eight friends of Florida State gunman Myron May are expecting a package from the man who opened fire at the university library. The group of people say they don’t know what the packages contain; they’ve simply been told to call police as soon as they arrive. (Source: WSB-TV)May was armed with a .380 semi-automatic handgun when he shot three people Wednesday night, according to police. Investigators said May tried to get past security barriers before he was fatally shot by officers.Photos: Gunman shot, killed on Florida State University campusPolice say they have a journal and videos that indicate May believed the government had targeted him. WSB-TV’s Liz Artz spoke to Joe Paul, a friend of May, on Thursday. Paul said Mays sent a message on Facebook asking for his address and told him the package had been mailed and should arrive Friday. “It clicked. I said, ‘Wait a minute, he sent a message to us all about a letter he was going to be sending us, or a package, to all of us to arrive Friday’. This is all connected,” Paul said.

Police investigate a shooting at Strozier Library on Florida State campus on Nov. 20, 2014, in Tallahassee, Fla.Paul attended Florida State with May and told Artz the two reconnected while living in Houston.  “People were a little afraid. Why did he choose us, that’s a lingering question. Why us?” Paul said. Paul said the seven other friends do not know each other and they are not aware of any link aside from their relationship with May.“Perhaps it’s an answer to why,” Paul said. Paul described May as calm, a mild-mannered person who was friendly.PREVIOUS REPORT:A 19-year-old Florida State University freshman from metro Atlanta was in the library studying when gunshots rang out.“I had been in the library for about four hours. We heard two fairly loud noises. No one knew what it was,” she said.>> Read more trending stories  The student, an exercise science study major who asked that her name not be published, had been on the first floor working on a chemistry report and was in the process of moving to a quieter place to work when the incident occurred. Just when she placed her things down at her new work space, pandemonium broke out.“All of a sudden everyone was scrambling and trying to get out,” she said. “It was so chaotic.”She and some friends hustled out a back entrance and got outside, where the frenzy followed them.“We just didn’t know what to do,” she said. “Everyone was running around on the sidewalks. We made it to a building that was next door.”The student, a graduate from Walton High School in east Cobb County, said she and numerous classmates stayed in the adjacent building for a couple of hours before they were given the all-clear.“All the police officers were really comforting,” she said. “It felt like we were safe. When it came time to leave all the cops were really helpful.”Related
