I am a long time friend of his… He is from a very very little town of under 1,000 people in the south I might add. Religion is a very dominant thing in that area. He is not this monster that the media or you ignorant “know it all’s” are making him to be. He was always kind to everyone despite this heinous act. He was a gentle being with a positive attitude and sense of humor that could light anyone up at their lowest point. He talked me off the ledge so to speak. Nobody who knew him ever even thought this was possible, we’re still in disbelief. He was always a great athlete, super successful (passed the bar in TX, NM, and was studying for the FL bar), he was great with children. He never EVER had a temperament. Stress is a killer. We will never know what drove him to this. I wish I knew what the hell he was thinking but moreso I wish he had the support he gave to everyone else. This is NOT how I will remember him. I’m sure there will be plenty of negativity to follow my comment by people who know nothing. However I will not engage or entertain it but I will say ahead of time GFY if you want to argue with me b/c I know who he truly was you did not…

No one is calling him a monster. The media is actually being very sensitive of his mental health.

What I read and tend to believe is that he was under the influence of some prescription med(s).  The overall perception or opinion is that he was otherwise incapable of carrying out such an act.

I wonder what made this man go off in such a violent manner ……. Fortunately, he was a poor shot.  Sure, the word “targeting” comes up, but isn’t that to be expected in these Post 9/11 – NSA – Patriot Act days and times?  The day is coming when we are going to be forced to check in somewhere, somehow, at a certain time-of-day, to be evaluated by our body suit , apparel, or clothing as well as by way of helmet , face masks, gloves and footwear readouts, e. g., vitals, EKG, EEG, MRI, PET, mood, etc., to see if we need to be soothed by way of chemicals blasted inside of us through our pores.  One never knows what the present solutions to today’s problems may bring by way their inevitable creation of problems in the future.

#1 – Ever considered the mentally ill ones are the ones writing these “propaganda” & “fear” themed articles (as they’re told)? (Just pay attention to the adjectives and descriptives).
#2 – Ever consider Mr. Myron May was right in what he was saying?
