Auden Tate was one of the top prospects in attendance Saturday at the IMG NFA 7v7 National Championships. The Tampa (Fla.) Wharton receiver made several catches for Team Tampa.
Tate is a composite three-star recruit who has seen his stock rise recently, as teams covet his 6'4.5, 202-pound size. One team that has been showing considerable interest in Tate is Florida State.

"I wouldn't say they lead, but the visit was great," Tate said of Florida State. "That's one of the few visits that I really liked. The coaches didn't promise me nothing, and told me I could come work for a spot. At receiver, they do real good with spreading the ball around."
Tate is being recruited by receivers coach Lawrence Dawsey, who played the position for Florida State and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and recruits the Tampa area. He spoke of his relationship with Dawsey.
"Great. I talk to him a lot, and he talks to my parents a lot," Tate said of Dawsey. "He's very up front."
Florida State has a plan for Tate, and it helps that it recently used the plan with a receiver of similar size: Kelvin Benjamin.





"He wants me to be the mis-match receiver, on smaller corners, inside, outside," Tate said. "Like Kelvin Benjamin. I watched him and how they used him and his body when they throw him the ball."
Tate plans to take all five of his official visits, and knows that Michigan and Florida State will be receiving two.
Maryland is a school that is in the picture.
"I like them," Tate said of Maryland. ¬†"They're on me, and they have a need at receiver. I can play early and it's a good area. I'll be up there next week with (fellow recruits) Ray-Ray McCloud, George Campbell, Byron Cowart."




What will Tate's decision ultimately come down to?
"How I feel about the campus and how my mom and dad feel about the school," Tate said.
Tate also holds offers from Florida, South Carolina and Ohio State.
Tate has been invited to Nike's The Opening in Portland and SB Nation Recruiting will catch up with him in early July at the event.
