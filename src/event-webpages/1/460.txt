Flying banners above college football games is a pretty common practice. Today, before Miami (FL) takes on Florida State in Sun Life Stadium, it appears that someone flew a “Stop Rape & Domestic Abuse. Beat FSU.” banner above the stadium. Check it out:

This appears to be a not-so-subtle jab at Seminoles QB Jameis Winston, as he has been accused of sexual assault in the past. Winston has a Title IX hearing regarding the case later this year.
The game between the ‘Noles and the Hurricanes will kick off at 8:00 P.M. EST. You can watch it on ABC.
