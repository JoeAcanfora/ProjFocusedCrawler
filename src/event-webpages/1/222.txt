Huge commitment for FSU

6'2 310 4 DT Arguably the most important recruit left for #FSU #Noles RT @djjones_44: Glad to be apart of #NoleNation http://t.co/dqEraOGbZV‚Äî TomahawkNation.com (@TomahawkNation) July 20, 2014

D.J. Jones, one of the most important targets for the Florida State Seminoles, has committed to Florida State after his official visit this weekend. Jones is a 6'2, 310-pound JUCO DT, and given that FSU's projected defensive tackle situation could be quite iffy entering 2015, Jones could easily put three. I'm covering ACC Media Days, and will have more on this later in the week.

Another excellent 2017 commit

twitter.com

Chris Nee of Noles247 told me that this kid's dad played for FSU with Odell Haggins. He'll be a DT. Good length. Had a good camp. This seems like a very good take of a player from the Gainesville area.

Big news on star OL Cole Minshew
6'6, 319-pound offensive line recruit Cole Minshew, an FSU commitment, was expected to visit Georgia's "Dawg Night" camp Friday, so it was a bit of a shock when the Douglas (Ga.) Coffee County star walked through the gates at Florida State camp late Thursday night -- particularly because he already visited for the June session.
I had a short conversation with Minshew after the session.
Tomahawk Nation: Hey Cole, are you still visiting UGA Friday for Dawg Night? And if not, is UGA still in it for your recruitment?
Minshew: "No sir, I'm not, and no sir, they ain't."
Minshew appears to be done with his recruitment, and that's great news for Florida State because this is a player who has looked better and better each of the four times I have seen him play. He is an enormous, nasty mauler capable of being a great guard or perhaps a right tackle. Previously, there was considerable worry that UGA would be able to flip the Peach-State product.

FSU recruiting: Jimbo Camp Updates
Florida State's Jimbo Fisher football camp begins Wednesday, and this is the recruiting event Florida State fans have been waiting for. The Seminoles are¬†looking to sign about 24-27 players in the class (27 only if they have studs beating down their door). This event looks to be extremely loaded.
As we saw with the last camp, FSU is being very selective and stingy with some offers. Having a "road" game at Miami in front of many South Florida recruits, and the uncertainty swirling in Gainesville, may yield opportunities for FSU to be in a position to grab some players it otherwise would not have landed. It needs to have spots open later in the year and not be in a position which forces it to tell numerous commits to look elsewhere.
I previewed the¬†offensive players early Tuesday, and the guys on the¬†defensive side of the ball on Tuesday night. This will be your spot for live updates in the comment section.
