De'Andre Johnson has been the headline several times already this year due to his performances, and this past week was no different. Johnson threw for over 200 yards, had 4 TD passes and also ran for 1 TD in First Coast's 42-0 beat down of Jackson. This time though, he really highlighted 2017 FSU commit, DJ Matthews. Matthews had 8 catches for 152 yards and 2 TDs.
Kai Locksley led Gilman to a 43-0 stomp of Loyola. Locksley showed off his athletic ability with 140 total yards passing and rushing and 3 TDs.





Jacques Patrick and Timber Creek fell in the final minute to Edgewater, 21-17. Patrick was held to nearly half his season average, only rushing for 125 yards. Patrick had been averaging around 235 yards a game. He ended the night with 1 TD rush and 1 TD pass.
Deondre Francois and IMG academy routed Lake Minneola 49-0. Francois did not get the start, but did throw for 75 yards with a TD and rush for 52 yards.
Keith Gavin and Wakulla crushed Bradford 48-0. Gavin caught 2 TD passes in the win.
 
At this time, we do not have any other specific stats for any other players. If you know of any other updates or were at any of the games, let us know in the comments.
