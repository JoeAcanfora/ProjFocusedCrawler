No Jameis Winston, no problem for Florida State. 
The No. 1-ranked Seminoles topped Clemson, 23-17, in overtime at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Fla. Saturday night. 
After stopping the Tigers on downs on the first possession of OT, FSU senior running back Karlos Williams scored the game-winning touchdown on a 12-yard rush. 

In Winston’s absence, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sean Maguire threw for 305 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions. Clemson freshman quarterback Dehaun Watson threw for 266 yards.
With the win, Florida State improves to 3-0, extending the nation’s longest winning streak. In defeat, Clemson drops to 1-2.
