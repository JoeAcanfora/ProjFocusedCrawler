It sounded like a gunshot but I thought if it was a gunshot there'd be chaos," Cohen said. "He came around the side of the building but didn't have his gun in the air. He had it down by his side, and then all of a sudden he lifted up his arms. He fired some shots at people in the area. He was about 20 feet away from me. He was looking right at me. He raised the gun. The guy fired one shot at me and shot the kid and he walked away."That kid is the 21-year-old friend he calls Ronnie -- Farhan Ahmed, who remained in the hospital Friday night with family by his side."(He) kept telling me to call 911 and I just said, 'What, you're shot? That was a real gun?' He said, 'Yeah, call 911,'" Cohen said.Ahmed had a bullet hole in his jacket."He said, 'I don't know if I'm going to be able to walk again. I can't feel my legs,'" Cohen said.Cohen said the shooter went inside the library."As I start dialing 911, he comes back out," Cohen said.To avoid being shot, Cohen gave Ahmed the phone with 911 dialing. A new report shows it was one of the victims who called for help.RELATED: FSU shooting victim from South FloridaCohen went to the side of the building and told police what was happening."The cops kept yelling, 'Drop the gun, drop the gun, drop the gun,'" Cohen said.Instead, Cohen said, May just stood there."In a very synchronized timing, you know, all the guns went off and fired at him," Cohen said. "(It) seemed like he wanted to die. I don't know why. He looked like there was nothing left. You know, he had nothing inside of him. Whoever this good guy was, that's what he became."
