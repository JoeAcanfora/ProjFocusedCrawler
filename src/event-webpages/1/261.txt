Myron De'Shawn May, the accused gunman who shot three early Thursday at the Florida State University library before being fatally shot by police, worked for a Houston law firm.
According to the Andrews Kurth Corporate and Litigation Law Firm in Houston, May at one time worked at that firm, but the secretary could not release when he was hired or when his employment ended. She did confirm that he was no longer a member of their team.
May also worked for Kennard Law in Houston. That firm had not comment.
Associated Press records show May was licensed to practice law in Texas and New Mexico.
May received his license to practice law in Texas in November 2009, about six months after receiving his Doctor of Jurisprudence from Texas Tech University in Lubbock.
May's Facebook page says he moved to Houston the following year. Public records list past addresses in both Houston and suburb Katy.
The State Bar's site currently still lists Houston as his primary practice location. However, no current firm was given on May's attorney profile. He has no public disciplinary actions on file. His statutory profile was last certified on Sept. 9, 2014.
May's Facebook profile states that he moved to Florida this fall.
Abigail Taunton, who runs a foster home in the Florida Panhandle, told the AP that May had recently been staying at a guest house she owns. She said police interviewed her husband, David, after the shooting.
"He's just a boy our kids grew up with that we let stay in one of our guest houses for a while," she said. "He's moving back home from Texas and we were trying to help him get on his feet.
"It's horrifying."
Taunton said he was planning to take the Florida bar exam in February.
"We're just all astounded. We had no idea that he would do something like this," Taunton said. "Obviously, he was not in his right mind."
She said she had known him since he was about 13 or 14 and that he ran cross country with her kids and stayed at her house a lot. She said he lived with his grandmother after coming out of a "bad situation" with his parents.
"He was a well-liked, real smart. He was having some financial issues and moved back home and decided he'd come back to Florida to work," she said. "My heart's broken. In a million years I wouldn't have thought he'd do something like this. He was struggling, having decided that what he was doing out there was not good. He had some issues and just decided he'd come home. He was struggling, like we all do, financially and otherwise."
The shooting happened about 12:30 a.m., sending hundreds of students who had been up all night studying for exams scrambling for cover in the book aisles and barricading themselves in with desks. Three students were wounded before police killed the gunman in a shootout, authorities said.
Police and FSU officials called the shooting an "isolated incident," but have not released many details, including how far May made it into Strozier Library. FSU's compact campus is located less than a mile from downtown Tallahassee and the state Capitol.
Please check back soon for more information on this developing story.
Brian Rogers of the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
