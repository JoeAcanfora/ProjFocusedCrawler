No. 1 Tight End In 2016 Class Tweeted His Commitment To Florida State
Dan Lyons

We’re still a few months away from Signing Day, but many of the top programs around the nation are already making waves in the 2016 recruiting class. Florida State just landed a huge commitment, nabbing the top tight end in the class, according to 247Sports’ composite rankings, Isaac Nauta of Buford, Georgia. Nauta tweeted his commitment to the ‘Noles.

Want to thank everyone and all the coaches that have recruited me, but I am proud to say that I am committing to Florida state University!
— Isaac Nauta (@inauta24) December 15, 2014

247Sports’ composite rankings has Nauta as the fifth best player in talent-rich Georgia. He reportedly also has offers from Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Florida, Georgia, Ohio State, and just about every other top program imaginable. Florida State’s 2016 class currently ranks third in the country.
