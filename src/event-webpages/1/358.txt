Florida State's Tomahawk Nation readers have read ad nauseum about how important it would be for members of FSU's 2015 recruiting class to enroll early, given that the team could potentially lose half of its starters to graduation or early draft entry.
That time has come, and of FSU's 21 commitments, it appears that FSU will be bringing on seven early enrollees, which is a strong number. Let's have a look at the seven.





Five-star defensive back Derwin James, of Haines City, and three-star defensive back Calvin Brewton, of Miami Central will both be in. James is considered a candidate for immediate playing time by almost every recruiting analyst, and Brewton is a heady player who needs to add significant strength. Getting in early will help both go through spring practice, pick up the system, and get the crucial extra months in the strength program.

Love it all ready up here

Five-star defensive end Josh Sweat, of Virginia, is also in early, and his early entry is important because of a serious knee injury he suffered during is senior season. Sweat will now be able to rehab with Florida State's medical staff and trainers. When I saw Sweat in late November, he was using a Hoveround/Jazzy to navigate FSU's campus, so I am skeptical of those who think he'll be back for spring practice.
Five-star receiver George Campbell, of Tarpon Springs' East Lake, will be in early and with Florida State returning seven scholarship receivers, Campbell is smart to get in early, work on his route running positioning, etc., especially if he is to play early. Four-star receiver Da'Vante Phillips, of Miami Central, is also in early. FSU fans would be thrilled if he could make the same impact that former Central teammate Dalvin Cook did as a freshman.





Four-star running back Jacques Patrick, of Orlando (Fla.) Timber Creek will benefit from time in the strength and conditioning program, and will begin to learn the offense. FSU loses Karlos Williams, who was good for the Seminoles in short yardage, and at a minimum, Patrick should get a look there.
Three-star QB De'Andre Johnson, of Jacksonville (Fla.) First Coast is also in early -- the only QB of FSU's three commits to do so. Johnson capped an incredible high school career by winning Mr. Florida, the highest honor for a HS player in the state. He'll now get to show his stuff to FSU's coaches.

Special day for our new arrivals!! #TheWorkBegins! #NewStreak!

In the event that a planned early enrollee does not arrive, Tomahawk Nation will update its readers on their progress.
Florida State will likely sign 25 or more recruits in the 2015 class, which is currently No.2  nationally behind only Alabama. More on that Tuesday.
