Florida State’s OL All Wrote “RT” On Their Wrists To Support Coach Rick Trickett
Matt Lombardi

Florida State’s big matchup with Notre Dame Saturday night was easily its most important contest of the season. Unfortunately, one very important member of the staff – offensive line coach Rick Trickett – had to miss it because of a health issue. The players he coaches on a daily basis made sure he was there in spirit, however. 
Trickett, who was reportedly checked out for a potential heart issue, was honored by the team’s offensive line during the game. The players all wrote his initials – “RT” – on their wrists for the game. Here’s a photo:

Trickett appears to be doing better, and should not have any long-term effects from the issue. It’s great to see that his players still remember what’s important, even right before a huge game.
