Video: Florida State’s Freshman QB J.J. Cosentino Threw A Football Over A 4-Story Building
Matt Lombardi

At this point, it’s safe to say that Florida State recruits quarterbacks with absolute cannons. Last year, we saw a video of eventual Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston throwing a football over the school’s Pike house – something that supposedly had never been done before. This time around, we’ve got FSU’s newest addition – freshman four-star signal-caller J.J. Cosentino – chucking one over a four-story building in Tallahassee. 
Check out the Instagram video he posted yesterday.

Cosentino will obviously not be playing any time in the near future, given Winston’s role as the starter for at least another year (maybe more). Whenever he does get an opportunity, it doesn’t look like getting the ball downfield will be an issue for him.
