2015 quarterback Deondre Francois worked out during Thursday's session of the Jimbo Fisher Camp and looked great.
Not only did the 6'1, 195 pound Francois get to work seven-on-seven drills, but he also had a chance to work close to Jimbo Fisher, getting advice on balance and the three-step drop. He showed great footwork and balance.








"I am just happy to be here with the atmosphere and these guys," Francois said. "I am learning from the other quarterbacks and Coach Fisher. Just taking everything in."
He has a natural release and delivers the ball with accuracy, hitting receivers in full stride. Along with his ability to get out of the pocket and make plays with his feet, Francois also seems at home in the pocket. He may not have the intimidating stature that some of the other quarterbacks possess these days, but he's as fluid as they come.



But this wasn't Francois' first trip to Florida State, somewhere he says he has become very comfortable. And he's hoping for even more one-on-one time with Fisher and the staff.





"I'm hoping I can get a private session in the indoor facility and we can go from there," Francois said.
Francois still has a visit ahead of him and he's not in any hurry to commit anywhere just yet, but Florida State should feel good about its relationship with the young quarterback. While Francois had planned on visiting Oregon and Notre Dame before his decision, those visits will no longer happen.
"I'm going to Auburn on Sunday and probably leave there on Monday or Tuesday, something like that," Francois said.
Francois says he doesn't plan on making his decision until the end of July and says its safe to say it's between Florida State and Auburn.
"It's important to me that my coach will be there for me on and off the field, and I definitely get that feeling from coach Fisher," Francois said. "Nobody has recruited me harder than Jimbo and that really means something to me."
