        TWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREPrayers filled the sanctuary of First Baptist Church on Sunday evening during a community service organized hours after Thursday's on-campus shooting at Strozier Library.Pastor Bill Shiell sensed it was needed. In addition to dispatching collegiate minister Zach Allen to Florida State's campus, Shiell called Pastor Thomas McDearis of Blacksburg Baptist Church. He witnessed the grief that stunned the nation and students in Blacksburg, Va., following the deadly April 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech.
    On Sunday, prayers were shared in light of Thursday's shooting on Florida State's campus.
    As many as 500 students were in Strozier when, at 12:25 a.m., gunman and FSU alum Myron May shot two students and an employee. Within minutes, police were on scene and shot and killed May.Shiell said Florida State wasn't Virginia Tech but "we have a lot to learn from the folks who have been there." He encouraged those at First Baptist, which is among many Tallahassee churches offering kindness and prayers, to make time for listening to those they encounter in the days and weeks to come."Right now is such a critical time for our community to be able to know there's a Christian, caring person in their lives and that we turned to a Christ who truly is the answer for the world today," said Shiell, who also addressed Saturday's fatal shooting of Leon County Sheriff's Office Deputy Chris Smith.Roughly 35 people, mostly church members, attended Sunday's late-day service and sang hymns, offered prayers and shared testimonies.Allen, who arrived on campus at 9:30 a.m. Thursday, personally talked to 50 or more students on campus and spent the morning texting and checking on students. Most said they were rattled but OK. A handful of them were church members who were inside the library during May's shooting spree.Allen arrived at FSU's Landis Green for the 10 a.m. vigil and by 8 p.m. that night, Allen said First Baptist did a campus-wide prayer service at Moore Auditorium in tandem with FSU Cru, a student organization that hosts weekly worship services.Emotional effects brought on by the shooting may not be seen for some time, Allen said.While wounds are fresh, the Tallahassee and Seminole community must remain unified, he said, adding current examples of unity from Twitter hashtags like #FSUnited, electronic billboards, garnet ribbons and stickers worn by FSU football players during Saturday's game against Boston College.Allen stressed support and unity must continue."The last thing I'll ask you to do is pray that this is an opportunity for our city and the churches in our city and campus ministries in our city to respond," he said. "There are so many times when we become callous to this after two weeks."
