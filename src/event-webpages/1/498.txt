The Florida-Florida State college football rivalry isn’t known to be on the same level as Alabama-Auburn or Ohio State-Michigan, but one Seminoles fan is apparently taking the intensity up a notch. 
Today, an FSU fan was spotted driving a car with a vanity plate aimed at Florida. 
It reads, “SCALP UF.” Check it out:

Florida State has won three of its last four contests against the Gators, who had dominated the rivalry prior to that, winning six contests in a row. Florida leads the series, 34-22-2. 
The two squads will meet on the field this season on Nov. 29 in Tallahassee.
