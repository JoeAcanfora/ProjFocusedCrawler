This was recorded late Wednesday night, before the departure of Sal Sunseri and the hire of Brad Lawing, but I don't believe the switch will have a major impact on this recruiting cycle.

CeCe Jefferson, of Baker County, had some interest in Florida State before the hire. He officially visited earlier in the year.

According to a report, Florida State has made its coaching hire to replace Sal Sunseri, and it's a good one.

Byron Cowart has top two of Auburn, Florida. Unsure of FSU visit on 30th, per ESPN ($)

This is not a surprise to those who have followed recruiting over the years. The 5-star defensive end plays for Seffner (Fla.) Armwood, and Armwood players have not signed with Florida State. Period.
It's yet to be seen if Cowart will take his January 30 official visit to see Florida State. Cowart seems to change his mind daily, so stay tuned.

Braxton Miller enrolled at Ohio State for Spring semester

Ohio State spokesman confirms Braxton Miller is enrolled at OSU this spring semester. FYI FWIW‚Äî Tim May (@TIM_MAYsports) January 20, 2015

What does this mean for Florida State? Not much, considering Miller likely wouldn't be ready to throw in spring practice even if he were to come to FSU.

Only two weeks remain for Florida State before National Signing Day. Can the Seminoles hold on to some key recruits and add four or five?

Bobby Bowden fine with Joe Paterno getting wins back, wants his back, too

Seems pretty reasonable. Vacated wins are a stupid penalty in any situation IMO. Full article here, via Mike Bianchi.

A closer look at Notre Dame's pass defense




110




  posted by Bud Elliott
    on Oct 13, 2014





Notre Dame is allowing a QB rating of 112 against Power 5 opponents, good for No. 24 in the country. 
But as we see from this chart, those opponents have only posted a QB Rating of 114 against other Power 5 teams. The takeaway? The passing offenses faced by Notre Dame so far have not been very good. This has not been adjusted for garbage time, of which there has been some.
Much more to come this week.
