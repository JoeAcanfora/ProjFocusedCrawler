It's always hard seeing high school kids get injured. Unfortunately this week, injuries took center stage. It all started last week when 5-star defensive end target CeCe Jefferson left the game with an apparent shoulder injury. News came out earlier this week that as a result of the injury, Jefferson would have season ending surgery.
Then news broke that FSU commit George Campbell would be held out of his game with concussion-like symptoms. But the biggest news of the night was that 5-star defensive end Josh Sweat had to be carted off the field. Word is that it is a knee injury and that there was a possible dislocation, but no breaks. New on the injury can be found¬†here. We'll do our best to bring you any updates on these players.





This week's commits and targets in action.
Nyqwan Murray and Oak Ridge with another close game, this time a last minute drive provides the win over Wekiva, 18-12. Murray continued scoring touchdowns in masses. This time, Murray ended up with 185 yards and 2 touchdowns.
Derwin James and Haines City fell to Lakeland 25-12. James caught a touchdown pass in the loss.
Da'Vante Phillips and Miami Central took down Columbus 42-14. Phillips had a touchdown catch in the game.
Keith Gavin and Wakulla crushed Taylor, 50-14. Gavin had two touchdown catches.
Deondre Francois and IMG academy win their 3rd straight with a 43-7 victory over Montverde. Francois tossed two touchdowns in the victory.





Kai Locksley and Gilman shutout Good Counsel 20-0. Locksley threw a 50+ yard bomb for a touchdown, he also had a touchdown run in this game.
Deandre Johnson and Jacques Patrick were both off this week.
At this time, we have no other specific stats for any of the other recruits. If you know of any or were at any of the games and want to give some input, we welcome them in the comments.
