WR Josh Malone of Station Camp (Gallatin, TN) and his team lost in the second round of the playoffs in a heartbreaker against Hendersonville (TN) by a score of 28-29. Station Camp ended the season at 9-3. A lot of recruitniks are projecting him to end up at Tennessee, but he did recently send in early enrollment papers to 4 schools, and FSU was included.
DT Thomas Holley of Lincoln (Brooklyn, NY) had another monster game racking up 6 tackles, 4 TFLs, and a sack in a 39-8 win over New Utrecht (Brooklyn, NY). They will advance to the next round of the playoffs as they host Flushing (NY) on 11/23 at 12 PM.
WR Travis Rudolph of Cardinal Newman (West Palm Beach, FL) had a punt return go back for a TD and also had a pick 6 in a playoff win over Chaminade-Madonna (Hollywood, FL) by a score of 40-13. They will now be taking on Westminster Christian (Miami, FL) on 11/22 at 7:30 PM for the regional championship.
WR Malachi Dupre of Curtis (River Ridge, LA) and his team will begin their title bid as they host St. Charles Catholic (LaPlace, LA) on 11/22 at 7 PM.
DE Jalyn Holmes of Lake Taylor (Norfolk, VA) and his team got their first playoff victory in a 35-7 win over Nansemond River (Suffolk, VA). They will now be hosting Hanover (Mechanicsville, VA) on 11/22 at 7:30 PM in the next round of the playoffs.
RB Dalvin Cook of Miami Central (Miami, FL) got a playoff win against Boynton Beach (FL) in a high scoring 55-37 affair. They will now advance to take on Dillard (Fort Lauderdale, FL) on 11/22 at 7 PM.
OT David Sharpe of Providence (Jacksonville, FL) and his team lost in the first round of the 3A playoffs to Trinity Catholic (Ocala, FL) by a score of 13-30. Sharpe was set to make his announcement last Thursday but has now postponed the decision. Many are thinking he will going to UF now.

That's it for this week. These games are getting big and the competition is getting better for these players. Sometimes players who have not been doing too well during the regular season really shine in these games. Devonta Freeman is an excellent example as he had a ridiculous playoff run statistically and led his team to a state title.

As always if you have the chance to see any of these games, please let us know what you see in the comments section!
