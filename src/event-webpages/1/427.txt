Video: NC State QB Jacoby Brissett Escapes Pressure, Throws A Beautiful TD Pass Against Florida State
Bill DiFilippo

NC State quarterback Jacoby Brissett is lighting up Florida State today. The redshirt junior quarterback has gone 12-for-17 with 194 yards and two touchdowns, and made one of the most impressive plays that you’ll see. 
The Wolfpack offense was facing a 3rd-and-6 in Florida State’s red zone, Brissett took the snap, evaded pressure in the pocket, rolled out to his right, managed to fight off a defender who had him wrapped up, and threw a dime to WR Johnathan Alston for a touchdown. Check it out:

The play gave NC State a 24-7 lead late in the first quarter, but the Seminoles have fought back, and the Wolfpack’s lead is now 24-21. It’s been an entertaining game thus far, and you can watch it on ABC or ESPN2.
