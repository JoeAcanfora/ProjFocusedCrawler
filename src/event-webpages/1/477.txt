Jameis Winston is not a small human being by any stretch of the imagination. According to Seminoles.com, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner is 6-foot-4, so there aren’t many people who can make Winston look like he’s a short dude.
FSU basketball recruit Christ Koumadje is one of those people. Koumadje — a three-star recruit who committed to the school last month — is listed at 7-foot-4, a full foot taller than Winston. Today, a picture of Koumadje meeting Winston was posted on Twitter, and as you can guess, Koumadje dwarfs the Seminoles’ quarterback. Check it out:

This is a hilarious visual. Not many people can make Winston look tiny, but Koumajde is so huge that he makes Winston look like a child.
