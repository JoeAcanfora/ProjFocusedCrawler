The Florida State athletic department is currently a couple years into an eight-year, $250 million project that will upgrade its facilities. 
As part of the project, much of the Seminoles’ football complex will receive a facelift. A decent amount has already been constructed. The renovations are extremely impressive. 
Thursday afternoon, Florida State’s official recruiting Twitter account tweeted out some graphics of what the Seminoles’ new players’ lounge and position meeting rooms will look like. Check it out:

Florida State didn’t really need much more help on the recruiting trail, but the Seminoles will get it with these upgraded facilities. Jimbo Fisher’s 2015 class is currently ranked No. 2 in the country by 247 Sports’ Team Rankings.
