Here Are The Lines For Projected Alabama vs. Florida State, Oregon vs. TCU Matchups
Bill DiFilippo

If the college football season ended today, Alabama, Oregon, TCU and Florida State would be the four teams that have earned the right to play in the College Football Playoff, according to the most recent rankings released by the selection committee. In this scenario, the Crimson Tide and the Seminoles would play in the Sugar Bowl, while the Ducks and the Horned Frogs would meet at the Rose Bowl.
According to Las Vegas, if this ends up happening, Alabama and Oregon would be the favorites to advance to the national championship game. Nick Saban’s squad would be 11.5 point favorites to upend Florida State, while Mark Helfrich’s team would be favored by 2.5 over TCU, according to LVSuperBook.

There’s still one more week of college football that needs to be played, and there’s always the chance that any of these teams won’t make it into the Playoff. What do you think, do these lines seem right?
