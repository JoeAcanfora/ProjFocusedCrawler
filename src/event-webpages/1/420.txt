Video: Florida State Shows Off Facilities Renovations
Dan Lyons

Florida State is certainly making the most of its 2014 National Championship. FSU has spent the off-season renovating its various football facilities, and the results are quite impressive. We had previously seen some pictures from the facilities, but now FSU has released an official “behind the scenes” video.
 
The video features head coach Jimbo Fisher, and current players Rashad Greene and Jameis Winston describing the importance of these facilities, especially in recruiting. After seeing the video, it’s easy to see why Florida State has been dominant in recruiting as of late.
