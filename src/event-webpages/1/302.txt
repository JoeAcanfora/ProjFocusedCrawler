PLANT CITY



A man was charged Friday with animal cruelty after Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies found a water buffalo calf tied to a fence post and in distress, the sheriff's office said.The calf's head was bound by rope, which rubbed against one of its eyes and dug deep into its neck.Antonio Casamento, 45, of Tampa, apparently tied the calf to the fence at 2905 S Frontage Road in October 2014 and never adjusted the rope to accommodate the calf's growth, the sheriff's office said. The calf appeared Friday to be six or seven months old.Sheriff's Office agricultural detectives did not find issues with any of the other livestock on the property. The injured calf was being cared for by a veterinarian, the sheriff's office said.Casmento was released early Saturday from Hillsborough County jail on $500 bail.
