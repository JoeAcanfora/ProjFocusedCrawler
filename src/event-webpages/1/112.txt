Noles and Tide: Game Preview and Thread
Florida State is in a position that they haven't been in since 2008, coming off a loss in a regional. They had won 19 games in a row which is remarkable but they were completely dominated last night being outscored 7-0 and out hit 16-2 by a very good offense. The future of Georgia Southern's Sam Howard is going to be a good one as he is expected in the top four or five rounds next weekend, the left hander threw a complete game shut out limiting the Noles to just six balls that were hit out of the infield.
Alabama didn't fare much better as they were shutout by Kennesaw State. Their offense was hacking early and appeared to be extremely undisciplined at the plate which seems to be a common characteristic¬†of this team, hopefully something the Noles can take advantage of today with their ace on the mound. Lose today and your season is over, fortunately the Seminoles are the better team and are in better position to advance.

Florida State is led by the ACC Player of the Year DJ Stewart (.348/.469/.561) and are protected by fellow first teamers in John Nogowski (.311/.433/.451) and Jose Brizuela (.325/.407/.453). The Noles are constantly on base as they lead the nation in walks, which constantly pressures opposing pitchers lending them to score as many runs as they do.
Outside of some power, second to only Kentucky in homeruns within the SEC, there is not much that Alabama does well. They struggled to score last season and that has continued in 2014 with an unimpressive on-base percentage and the fact that they strike out more than twice as much than they walk. The offensive leaders for the Tide are All SEC Team members Ben Moore (.305/.363/.486) and Wade Wass (.305/.398/.468), the right fielder Moore leads the team with 9 homeruns while Wass, the designated hitter is more free swinging.

The Seminoles received some fantastic news this week as starting pitcher Brandon Leibrandt (39.1 IP/1.02 WHIP/6.86 K/9) will see action for the first time in two months. Luke Weaver¬†(101.1 IP/1.04 WHIP/7.19 K/9)¬†¬†will more than likely be a top 50 draft pick next week while reliever Gage Smith¬†(60.1 IP/0.94 WHIP/4.62 K/9)¬†can be used in just about every situation. As a staff Alabama is not great, their strikeouts per nine is not strong (they do have groundball pitchers) but a walks per nine approaching four is bad for business especially when you have three teams in your region with strong offenses.

As mentioned in the regional preview article both of these teams have extremely potent offenses. There is no questioning the Seminoles but just how much of the Eagles numbers are inflated because they play in a weak conference. If you compare the pitching the Southern Conference walks over four batters per nine whereas the ACC is at 3.6 while the strikeout to walk ratio is at 2.1 for the ACC and 1.8 for the Southern. The number that really stands out is the amount of homeruns allowed, Southern Conference pitchers surrendered a homerun every 55 at bats, that is nearly twice as frequent as the ACC who only allowed a homerun every 102 at bats. I don't want to discredit this offense because I am sure they are talented but have they have not played at the highest level like the Seminoles have.
Florida State is led by the ACC Player of the Year DJ Stewart (.348/.469/.561) and are protected by fellow first teamers in John Nogowski (.311/.433/.451) and Jose Brizuela (.325/.407/.453). The Noles are constantly on base as they lead the nation in walks, which constantly pressures opposing pitchers lending them to score as many runs as they do.
Georgia Southern is currently tied for fourth in the country with an impressive 59 homeruns this season. There are seven players on the lineup that have hit at least five homeruns on the season, for reference Florida State only has two. Aaron Mizell (.313/.390/.545) and Stryker Brown (.325/.409/.522) are the team's best bats who have combined to hit 23 homeruns and look to take advantage of the short right field fence that favors left handed hitters.

The Seminoles received some fantastic news this week as starting pitcher Brandon Leibrandt (39.1 IP/1.02 WHIP/6.86 K/9) will see action for the first time in two months. While he probably won't start seeing him pitch in any capacity is a huge pitch for the Noles chances of reaching Omaha. Luke Weaver¬†(101.1 IP/1.04 WHIP/7.19 K/9)¬†¬†will more than likely be a top 50 draft pick next week while reliever Gage Smith¬†(60.1 IP/0.94 WHIP/4.62 K/9)¬†can be used in just about every situation. This staff is coming off a great ACC tournament in which they allowed 6 earned runs on 21 hits in 26 innings striking out 23 and issuing 8 walks.
There are some quality arms on the Eagles staff, they have the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year in right hander Josh Wirsu¬†(92.2 IP/1.12 WHIP/8.55 K/9)¬†¬†and a projected early round pick in Sam Howard¬†(86.2 IP/1.12 WHIP/8.72 K/9)¬†, both have been used as the ace this season. If they can throw deep in the game Georgia Southern can turn the ball over to Jason Richman¬†(84.2 IP/1.12 WHIP/8.40 K/9)¬†who leads the nation with 46 appearances.

Georgia Southern has the conference pitcher of the year on their staff, he is not starting tonight's game and rightfully so. He is not the best pitcher on this team, that honor goes to left hander Sam Howard who is an excellent prospect who will probably be drafted in the first few rounds of the amateur draft next week. The first stat that jumps of the page is his strikeout to walk ratio which is very high for a pitcher who strikes out as many as he does, not walking hitters will be key for him. ¬†Other numbers that stand out are 53,¬†59,¬†74,¬†101,¬†141,¬†168,¬†173,¬†187,¬†196,¬†210,¬†221,¬†292,¬†298, those are the RPI's of the teams he has faced this season, not a single one made the tournament. Who you play matters, last season I wrote an article about¬†Kyle McGowin and who he faced all season, McGowin struggled and Savannah State lost. Now I will absoutley concede that Georgia Southern is much better than Savannah State but to think that Howard will shut down Noles hitters because of his season's sucess season be a tough task.
Florida State's Mike Compton has a tough task ahead of him tonight as he faces an very strong lineup. The right hander is by no means a power arm with a lot of strikeouts, he relies on throwing a heavy ball and allowing runners to put the ball in play and trust his defense. This type of pitchers allows a high number of hits and Compton can get himself into trouble if he leaves the ball elevated. Compton has pitched at least five innings and allowed two or less runs in his last six starts, an outing like that today would be just fine. If he does get into trouble early look for Gage Smith or possibly Billy Strode who will be available from the pen if needed. Mike Martin, Jr. said today that Brandon Leibrandt is good to go and is available to start, he also mentioned that Jameis Winston could throw three straight days if needed and depending on the situation.

Outside of some power, second to only Kentucky in homeruns within the SEC, there is not much that Alabama does well. They struggled to score last season and that has continued in 2014 with an unimpressive on-base percentage and the fact that they strike out more than twice as much than they walk. The offensive leaders for the Tide are All SEC Team members Ben Moore (.305/.363/.486) and Wade Wass (.305/.398/.468), the right fielder Moore leads the team with 9 homeruns while Wass, the designated hitter is more free swinging.
There is no questioning the Owls Max Pentacost (.423/.477/.634), a talented, probable first round draft pick that is a huge threat in the middle of the lineup. Hitting cleanup for Kennesaw State is center fielder Bo Way (.364/.414/.481) who is also a threat on the base paths, he has been successful in 10 of 13 attempts. Every other starter in the lineup has struck out more than they have walked and all possess an on-base percentage of .350 or lower.

As a staff Alabama is not great, their strikeouts per nine is not strong (they do have groundball pitchers) but a walks per nine approaching four is bad for business especially when you have three teams in your region with strong offenses. The Tide are led by Spencer Turnbilll¬†(87 IP/1.16 WHIP/6.10 K/9)¬†who allows very few hits but walks an extremely large number of batters while All ACC honors were awarded to freshman reliever Thomas Burrows (33.1 IP/0.87 WHIP/8.64 K/9)¬†.
Kennesaw State pitchers have been on the bad end of some horrid defense behind them, you are able to tell that from their poor fielding percentage and the fact that their pitchers have a high BABIP (batting average on balls in play). The do have some fantastic bullpen arms in James Connell¬†(42.2/1.28 WHIP/8.53 K/9)¬†and Justin McCalvin (56.1 IP/1.02 WHIP/8.98 K/9)¬†, it will be very interesting to see how they are used if their starting pitchers find themselves in trouble early.

Weaver Sets A Tone, Albeit Light-Hearted, For FSU
Here is a¬†link and an excerpt from an article Baseball America released this morning on Florida State's ace.

"I think he enjoys life," Florida State pitching coach Mike Bell said. "It's not to the point where he's arrogant, but he enjoys day-to-day humor, he enjoys being loose, loosey-goosey, for six days. When it's time to work, it's time to work. When it's time to have fun, hey, let's enjoy life. But on Friday when it's 6 o'clock, it's a different guy."

Weaver will likely get the starting nod in game two of regionals.
