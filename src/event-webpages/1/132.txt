It was quite a week for Florida State recruiting, as it saw commits from stud running back¬†Jacques Patrick and 5-star corner¬†Tarvarus McFadden. Make sure to check out Tomahawk Nation's write up on both of these commitments.
Derwin James returned from an injury with an immediate impact in Haines City's 30-16 victory over Jenkins. James had 2 defensive touchdowns on the night. He returned an interception 50 yards for a TD and also returned a fumble 60 yards for a TD. And to top it all off, he forced 3 fumbles.





Jacques Patrick, fresh off his commitment, torched Oviedo for over 220 yards. But in the end, it wasnt enough as Timber Creek lost 28-21. Patrick had 2 touchdown runs and threw for another.
De'Andre Johnson guided First Coast to a 34-7 win over Sandalwood. Johnson kept up his video game numbers, throwing for 354 yards and 4 TDs.
Deondre Francois and IMG defeated Clearwater Central Catholic, 50-21. Francois rushed for 98 yards and 2 TDs, while throwing for 192 yards and 2 TDs.
George Campbell and East Lake crushed Northeast, 49-14. Just four plays into the game, Campbell retuned a punt for a touchdown and poured it on from there. He tacked on another punt return touchdown and caught a 19 yard touchdown pass.
Johnny Frasier helped Princeton defeat Lakewood, 60-0. He had three touchdowns on the night.





Keith Gavin and Wakulla took down Rickards for a playoff spot, 36-7. Gavin had a 22 yard TD reception in the win.
Da'Vante Phillips and Miami Central beat Jackson, 45-0. Phillips had over 100 yards receiving and 1 TD reception.
Tarvarus McFadden and American Heritage suffocated Gibbons, 50-0. McFadden blocked a FG attempt and caused a fumble in the victory.
Just a fun stat that I saw on twitter over the weekend, Patrick and Frasier have combined to rush for 168 TDs and over 11,000 yards since 2012.
There are no other specific stats for any other recruits at this time. If you know of any other or were at any games, please fee free to provide any info in the comments section.
