TALLAHASSEE -- A man who shot three people at a Florida State University library had complained to police and property managers in New Mexico that cameras were watching him in his apartment, and that he heard voices talking about and laughing at him, according to police reports released Friday.Myron May walked into the Las Cruces Police Department in September to report that he was almost certain there were cameras installed in his apartment and that he could hear voices commenting on his activities, a police report said.May, a 2005 Florida State graduate, returned to the school early Thursday and shot two students and a library worker before reloading his semi-automatic pistol. Police responded within two minutes and fired off a barrage of bullets that killed him.University police participated in active shooter training less than two weeks before the attack, including a scenario with a shooter at the library. "It's good to know we look at those opportunities where someone may try to harm our students," university Police Chief David Perry.Videos and a journal obtained by police indicate he thought he was being watched and targeted by the government.The first 911 call from the shooting Thursday came from one of the victims, according to a Tallahassee police report released Friday. The victims are student Elijah Velez, 18, who was grazed by a bullet and treated at the scene; student Farhan Ahmed, 21, who was in critical condition when admitted to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital and was still being treated Friday, and library employee Nathan Scott, 30, who was shot in the leg. Police did not say which one called 911, but there were several more calls that followed.In another development, authorities Friday were examining packages May sent to friends before the Florida State shooting.Joe Paul, a Washington, D.C., resident and motivational speaker who knew May from their time in Florida State student government, said postal inspectors intercepted a package May sent to him. The inspectors told him that the package contained nothing dangerous, and promised they would release it to him.Paul said May mailed similar packages to about nine people. The FBI in Houston was examining a package delivered in Texas; others were believed to have been sent to Florida and elsewhere. Officials said the packages were not considered a threat.
