Florida State Sent A Recruit “75 Reasons” Explaining Why He Should Play For The Seminoles
Matt Lombardi

It would appear that whoever works in Florida State’s recruiting department has been very busy coming up with more than a few selling points on why high school players should be considering suiting up for the Seminoles. Monday, four-star offensive guard prospect Jalen Merrick tweeted out a photo of 75 different letters that the school had sent him. The first reads “Jalen, here are the 75 reasons why you should come to FSU!!” There’s also a graphic of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell holding up an NFL jersey with Merrick. It’s a strong move on FSU’s part.

Merrick, a native of New Smyrna Beach, Florida, is considered likely to stay in-state for college. We’ll see if the over-the-top push by Florida State proves to be the deciding factor.
