Week 8 of the NFL season means that there will be at least one seminole playing in every Sunday game. Kelvin Benjamin is coming off another successful week, in which he caught three passes for 61 yards and a touchdown. Telvin Smith also is looking to bring a performance just like last weeks, in which he recorded a statistic in most defensive categories. Here is your weekly list of former FSU Seminoles playing in the NFL in Week 8.
