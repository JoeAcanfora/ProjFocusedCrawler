Day  of Florida State's Jimbo Fisher Football Camp is in the books, and plenty of top recruits were on hand. Not all worked out, however, which is typical. In our recap, we will note who showed up for the afternoon session, and will tell you who stood out. Later, Stephen Fenech and Spencer Willis will be by to add details about the players they individually watched.
Quarterback
Feleipe Franks, of Wakulla (Fla.) is a surefire superstar QB recruit at 6'4 and 180 pounds in the class of 2016. He threw the ball well all day. FSU has not offered as of yet, but an offer would not be surprising. -BE





FSU 2015 QB commit De'Andre Johnson, of Jacksonville (Fla.) First Coast was also there, but did not work out. -BE
Running Back
Superstar 2015 RB Jacquez Patrick, of Orlando (Fla.) Timber Creek enjoyed the experience, but did not work out. He has a flight tomorrow up north for an Under Armour event, but said that he will also camp at Ohio State and may make the Michigan BBQ event. I personally think Patrick will end up in the SEC. -BE
Daryl Dunlap, running back class of 2014, had been solid. Verbally committed to San Diego state, Dunlap has stood out thus far in running back drills due to his size 6'2" and 220 pounds. -SF
Wide Receiver
Keith Gavin, a 2016 receiver out of Wakulla, was also quite impressive. He was working with the younger group for whatever reason, and belonged with the older players. Gavin already holds offers from FSU, UF and Clemson. -BE
Gilbert Johnson, a Georgia commit out of Miami (Fla.) Southridge looked pretty good. I spoke with him, and while he has recently visited Auburn and FSU, he is very solid to UGA because of his relationship with the Georgia coaches. -BE





Tight End
Mike Gesicki, of Manahawkin (N.J.) Southern Regional High School was very good. I was initially quite skeptical, given his long legs, because tight end is about being quick in short spaces, not being fast over longer distances with short strides. However, he showed he absolutely can move laterally. I spoke with Gesicki's dad, who said that he really enjoyed his visit. Most think the 6'5, 225-pounder will pick Ohio State, but his father said that Penn State and Wisconsin are also in the race, along with OSU and FSU. Tim Brewster was all over Gesicki. -BE
Davi'on Riley, of Lake Wales (Fla.) Impressed me with his body control. The 6'2, 210-pounder isn't Florida State quality, but he will play football in some BCS offense, as a pass-catching H-Back. He claims offers from Miami, Oregon, Tennessee and Wisconsin. The question will be how big he can get. -BE
Offensive Line
Christian Pellage, of Brooksville (Fla.) Nature Coast stood out to Spencer Willis. Willis will be along later to update us on what the 6'6, 250-pound 2015 offensive tackle did well.
FSU commit Alec Eberle, of Mechancsville (Va.) Atlee High School (outside Richmond) showed up in great shape at 6'4 and 279 pounds. He did not work out today, but does plan to tomorrow. He is loving his visit to Tallahassee so far, and has been working on his snapping in order to play center. It appears that FSU got a good one with its early offer here.
Derrick Kelly Jr., of Havana (Fla.) East Gadsen, also attended, but did not work out. He is extremely solid to Kentucky, and somewhat took offense when I asked him about a few other schools. He does not hold an FSU offer, and I doubt one will come if he does not elect to work out.
Defensive End
Rick Leonard, of Middletown (Md.) was the best prospect working out Tuesday. Spencer Willis saw him more than I did, and will have more on him later, but it's pretty well known that Leonard is down to Clemson and FSU. Willis told me that he moved extremely well for a 6'7, 250-pound man.  There is no way that he should be rated as a three-star. -BE
Speaking of Leonard, FSU defensive end commit Blake McClain, of Jacksonville (Fla.) Sandalwood, was working Leonard pretty hard and is optimistic that the Seminoles can land him. As always, McClain loves visiting FSU. -BE
Defensive Tackle
Adam Torres, of Lake Mary (Fla.) High School was in attendance. He is extremely well put together. Torres did not work out, but he did watch the defensive line reps, which jives with FSU recruiting him on the defensive line. -BE
Linebacker
I'm told FSU commit Delvin Purifoy was on hand on the sideline, but did not see him. He did not work out. -BE
Defensive Back
Kendall Sawyer, of Lehigh Acres (Fla.) East Lee High School was the best corner on the day. Coach Jeremy Pruitt made him take a bunch of reps, and watched him intently. Based on the praise, Pruitt liked his press technique, but did not like Sawyer quitting on some reps once beaten. Sawyer holds an FSU "offer." I asked him if he was thinking about committing, and he said maybe, but that he would have to speak with his parents. But he then told me that he likes FSU, Ole Miss, Miami, West Virginia and USF. He has not visited the two out-of-state schools, and will do so later in the year, via his official visits. Sawyer also said intends to take all of his official visits. It wouldn't shock me if he committed (he is camping all week), and it wouldn't shock me if he waits until National Signing Day.  -BE
Chris Jones, of Jacksonville (Fla.) Sandalwood might not have been as good as he was in June, but he was still good. He holds some MAC, Big East and lesser Big Ten offers, and is a good player. At this point I do not see an FSU offer coming. -BE
Nigel Edmonds, of Atlanta (Ga.) Westminster, was an impressive 2016 freshman corner to whom coach Pruitt paid a lot of attention -SF, SW.
Romeo Finley, of Ft. Walton Beach (Fla.) impressed as well. He is a solid 2016 safety prospect at 6'1 or 6'2 and about 190 pounds.
BE = Bud Elliott, SF = Stephen Fenech, SW = Spencer Wills.
