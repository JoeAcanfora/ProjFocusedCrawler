AND WE NOW KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL THREE VICTIMS. LIVE NEW IN TALLAHASSEE, WITH THE INCREDIBLE STORY OF ONE STUDENT THAT WITNESSED IT ALL. AND CALVIN, NOW THAT THE LIBRARY HAS OPENED YOU CAN SEE HERE, LIVE IS BACK TO NORMAL, BUT NOT TO EVERYONE. ESPECIALLY FOR A SOPHOMORE WE SPOKE WHO, WHO SPOKE ESCOLLUSIVELY TO LOCAL 10, ABOUT WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE OUT HERE THAT NIGHT, A NIECE WHERE HE ALMOST LOST HIS LIFE. THE LOOK ON HIS FACE, IS WHAT REALLY SCARED ME. EVERYTHING I SEE HAS THE BUY'S FACE, AND THE IMAGE OF HIM WITH THE GUN, AND HOOKING DOWN AT THE KID. THE SOPHOMORE WAS WITH A FRIEND OUTSIDE THE LIBRARY AT THE TABLES UNDER THE TREES. I HEARD A LOUD NOISE. I THOUGHT OFFENSE THE IT WAS A GUNSHOT THERE WOULD BE CHAOS. HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS GUN IN THE AIR, HE HAD IT BY HIS SIDE, AND THEN HE LIFTED UP HIS ARM AND FIRED SOME SHOTS. HE WAS ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY FROM ME, HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT AT ME, THE HE RAISED THE GUN, HE FIRED ONE AT ME, AND ONE AT THE KID. HE WALKED AWAY. THAT KID IS A FRIEND HE CALLED RONNIE, 21-YEAR-OLD, WHO TONIGHT REMAINS IN THE HOSPITAL WITH FAMILY BY HIS SIDE. HE KEPT ME TO CALL 9-1-1, WAIT, YOU ARE SHOT THAT IS A REAL GUN, HE SAID YEAH, CALL 9-1-1. HE HAS A BULLET HOLE IN HIS JACKET. HE SAID I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WALK AGAIN, I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS. HE SAYS THE SHOOTER WENT INSIDE THE LIBRARY. AS I START DIALING 9-1-1 HE COMES BACK OUT. TO AVOIDED BEING SHOT, HE -- A NEW REPORT SHOWS IT WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS WHO CALLED FOR HELP. COE WANT GOES TO THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING AND TELLS COPS WHAT IS HAPPENING. THEY KEPT YELLING DROP THE GUN, DROP THE GUN. HE SAYS HE JUST STOOD THERE. IN A VERY SYNCHRONIZED TIMING ALL THE GUNS WENT OFF, AND FIRES AT HIM. IT SEEMED LIKE HE WANTED TO TIE. I DON'T KNOW WHY. HE LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT. HE HAD NOTHING INSIDE OF HIM. WHOEVER THIS GOOD GUY WAS THAT'S WHAT HE BECAME. . IT WAS ONLY HOURS LATER THAT HE REALIZED HIS OWN JACKET HAS A BULLET HOLE, IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE ENTIRE INTERVIEW, WITH MR. COWAN, YOU CAN GO TO LOCAL10.COM REPORTING LIVE TONIGHT, LOCAL 10 NEWS.
