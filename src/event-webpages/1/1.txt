Myron May
The alleged gunman who shot three people at Florida State University before being killed by police formerly worked at a large, international law firm. According to police, FSU alum Myron De’Shawn May entered FSU’s Strozier Library and opened fire, prompting more than 300 students to evacuate the library or duck for cover.
As the investigation has progressed, reports surfaced that the shooter once worked at a small law firm, and a Biglaw firm in Texas…

Details are still coming out, but the Houston Chronicle is reporting that Myron May, a Texas Tech Law grad, worked at Kennard Law, and also in the Houston office of Andrews Kurth:
According to the Andrews Kurth Corporate and Litigation Law Firm in Houston, May at one time worked at that firm, but the secretary could not release when he was hired or when his employment ended. She did confirm that he was no longer a member of their team.
May also worked for Kennard Law in Houston. That firm had not comment.
Associated Press records show May was licensed to practice law in Texas and New Mexico.
According to the site Search for People, May also worked as a public defender, and most recently as a prosecutor in New Mexico.
As of this past Saturday, May was “on his computer studying for the [Florida] bar exam” while watching the FSU football game, according to Abigail Taunton of the Taunton Family Children’s Home, where he worked as in-house counsel. May was described as a “devout Christian,” and his last Facebook status was:
Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ~ Matthew 5:3
