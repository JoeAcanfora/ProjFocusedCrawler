Former Florida State DL Darnell Dockett Is Attempting To Recruit Braxton Miller To Tallahassee
Andrew Holleran

Out of all of Florida State’s former football players, Darnell Dockett is probably the one who is most active on Twitter. A lot of the time, the defensive lineman is tweeting at girls or talking trash about someone or something. 
Wednesday evening, though, Dockett was using his social media presence to attempt to help out his former program. 
The 6-foot-4, 290-pound defensive end is trying to get Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller to transfer to Florida State. 

@BraxtonMiller5 FSU or nah? Come on over bro, it’s cold in ohio, hit my DM I’ll make sure U good! We need U!
— DARNELL DOCKETT (@ddockett) January 7, 2015

Miller is a graduate transfer candidate and could play immediately at another school if he chooses to depart from Columbus. 
Will the two-time Big Ten Player of the Year return for one more season with the Buckeyes or play somewhere else? We’ll likely find out shortly after Ohio State’s national title contest against Oregon on Monday, Jan. 12.
