UNICEF is mobilizing relief to reach children and families most in need.
Typhoon Hagupit (or Ruby) made landfall in the Philippines on Saturday night as a category 3 storm. The full extent of damage is not yet known. The slow-moving typhoon brings with it threats of heavy rain, flooding and landslides. More than a million people are affected, including over 400,000 children, according to the latest estimates.
Just 13 months ago, Typhoon Haiyan brought terrible destruction to the island nation. More than 6,000 people died, and nearly 6 million children were affected. In Haiyan's aftermath, UNICEF provided children and families with water, health care, nutrition and protection. Today, UNICEF is dispatching supplies to the Eastern Samar municipalities hardest-hit by Typhoon Hagupit, the barangays of Dolores and Oras.  
Over the last year, UNICEF has worked with local governments to increase their ability to respond to natural disasters and is now joining the Philippine government and other partners in the current emergency response. In advance of Hagupit's landfall, UNICEF prepositioned supplies including water purification units, school tents, medical supplies and generators. UNICEF continues to work closely with its partners to maximize the delivery of critical aid.
