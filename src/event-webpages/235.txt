June is here already, can you believe it? Yes, me neither. Onto some volcano news! Guatemala Last week, we saw that activity at Pacaya in Guatemala picked up. So far, the eruptions are fairly small, with volcanic material being thrown hundreds of meters from the crater — likely this will only affect people living near […]

Some news from the world of volcanoes from this week: Italy Things are definitely heating up at Etna (no pun intended … ok, maybe a little pun). The Osservatorio Etneo reports that Bocca Nuova had its fifth Strombolian event (sounds tasty) of the new year — combine that with the two from the Southeast Crater […]

Stunning Whale Shark Photos Aim to Help At-Risk Species

At first glance, Kristain Schmidt and Shawn Heinrichs’ photos of models swimming with whale sharks off the coast of the Philippines appear heavily Photoshopped. But while the levels and colors have been manipulated and the backgrounds tweaked, the most striking part – the models’ proximity to sharks – is real.

We’ve had a flurry of volcanically-related news over the past day, so I thought I’d try to catch us up on it. Puyehue-Cordón Caulle I’ve seen a report today claiming a new eruption occurred at Puyehue-Cordón Caulle in Chile — reports from Chile/Argentina actually suggest that officials acknowledge this isn’t an eruption, but rumors, they […]

What Happens to All That Volcanic Ash?


By Erik Klemetti | 
Friday May 18, 2012



Share on Facebook0

The average volcanic eruption releases millions to trillions cubic meters of ash into the atmosphere. Most of it falls near the volcano, but a significant portion can travel far away, drifting in the atmosphere for hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of miles around the globe. That ash becomes the telltale signs of an eruption that may have much of its record erased by future eruptions or by the relentless powers of weathering, erosion and transport.
