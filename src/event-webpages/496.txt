          After a Year, Typhoon-Ravaged Tacloban Still Awaits Aid

AidevacuationFeaturednatural disastersPhilippinesreconstructionTaclobanTyphoon Haiyan 

















By  Trefor Moss 



A ruined building on the outskirts of Tacloban stands as a lingering reminder of the devastation from Haiyan a year after the storm hit.
TREFOR MOSS/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


“This is where a bit of metal almost cut off my ear,” said Thelma Gandia, a mother of five, wincing at the memory of the storm surge and hellish winds that devastated the San Jose shorefront neighborhood in Tacloban along with much of the central Philippines on Nov. 8, 2013.
One year after Typhoon Haiyan became the most powerful storm ever to hit the Philippines, The Wall Street Journal returned to Tacloban, scene of some of the most grisly devastation, to see how people are recovering.
The official death toll remains at 6,340; most of the 1,061 missing are believed to have been washed out to sea.Advertisement
As Trefor Moss reports, many survivors in Tacloban point to months of frustration, of waiting for the government to deliver on promises of long-term improvements such as stormproof houses and durable highways.



Ruby Bassas Agushin and her family are among the thousands of people still living in temporary homes and shelters in Tacloban a year after Haiyan hit.
TREFOR MOSS/THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


“We’re still hoping, always hoping. But after a year, we’ve given up expecting,” said Rosita Cabite, who was dismissive of assurances that she would receive a new house in a safe neighborhood away from San Jose’s lethal waterfront, to replace the badly damaged one she shared with two daughters and two grandchildren.
As of the end of October, 5,080 typhoon victims were still living in tents or evacuation centers across the central Philippines, according to the United Nations, with 19,700 in other shelters.
But signs of improvement are emerging as rural communities get back on their feet, and Tacloban is regaining some of its swagger as the region’s commercial center.
Read more about the government’s response and what reconstruction holds in store for the people whose lives were forever changed by last year’s superstorm.
