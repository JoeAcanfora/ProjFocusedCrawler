Texas Students Support Typhoon Haiyan Relief Efforts

Liz Thompson is Director of Marketing & Public Relations at Saint Mary's Hall. Students at Saint Mary’s Hall in San Antonio, Texas, raised $4,000 for Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts in the Philippines. The students presented the check to Henry Halff, a longtime supporter of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, during their weekly Chapel service on December 9. 












Before Thanksgiving, Upper and Middle School students worked together to raise funds for victims of the typhoon, which hit the Philippines in early November. Thanks to the efforts of the Saint Mary’s Hall community, a total of more than $5,100 is expected to be donated for disaster relief. 
The Saint Mary's Hall UNICEF Club, Project Teach, Asian Initiatives Club and the Middle School Community Service Council worked together to raise the funds through bake sales and an Out of Uniform Day for students, faculty and staff. Additionally, the French Club students raised around $1,000 that was donated to the American Red Cross.
“This check means a lot to me and it means a lot to UNICEF,” said Halff during a special assembly to thank the students. “But the main thing is what it means for the families in the Philippines who were devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. It means that families will be able to take baths, wash their clothes, and brush their teeth with supplies brought in by UNICEF and paid for with this check."
Community service is an integral part of the Saint Mary’s Hall experience. Students in every division are encouraged to volunteer. By the time students reach the Upper School, community service has become a big part of their lives, often creating a lifelong passion for service to others.
